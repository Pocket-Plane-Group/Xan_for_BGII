@3    = ~Ah-ha, I knew you'd come crawling back! Heh-heh.~
@4    = ~What, has the great and noble Xan of Evereska decided to honor the humble <CHARNAME> of Candlekeep with his divine presence at last?~
@5    = ~Not in this lifetime.~
@6    = ~Oh, do not be - difficult. You know perfectly well what I mean. I entreat you if I must: will you hear me out or no?~
@7    = ~Very well.~
@8    = ~I am sorry, Xan, but I have no interest in anything you might say to me in... private.~
@9    = ~Thank you for that. After all that has happened, I suppose I would not blame you, if... Thank you.~
@10   = ~'Crawling - ?' Perhaps you pre-empt me. Do not, as my father said, spend your wages before they are earned.~
@11   = ~Truly? Must it be so?~
@12   = ~And I... but no. It is your own decision. So much goes unsaid... but perhaps it is for the best. So be it. If that is your wish, I shall not trouble you again.~
@13   = ~Are we quite alone... ? Good. I have much to say, but I find none of it comes easily: like a jar with a narrow mouth.~
@14   = ~I suppose when we discuss these matters, we always begin in the abstract. After all, that's easier. To talk of you and I - that's difficult. But it is simple enough to say another thing, that has been the recent theme of my thoughts: I find I am not the man I once thought I was.~
@15   = ~I once called you a child, didn't I? And you are a child. My dear. But it was only my conceit to think that I was somehow... That I was not equally childish. Equally a fool.~
@16   = ~You see, all my life, I fear I have not been entirely honest. I do not mean I have changed my mind about the essentials: you will not find me swinging daisy chains and singing songs in the fields. I still believe what I have always said: we are put on this floating ball of the dust for no conceivable reason, and we know nothing but we pretend to know it, and sometimes I suspect that even the gods are as blind and as much a lot of fools as we are. I have believed these things since I was old enough to think.~
@17   = ~But perhaps, truth be told... I have often said one thing and done another.~
@18   = ~There is an elvish philosopher: an ancient, fearsome man. You would not know him. Even his name has been lost. But he has given us a saying to which certain of us moon elves, secretly, are felicitous: "The strong man cares nothing for life." And until this moment, I believed myself to be that man's disciple. You have always heard me say that life is hollow: that was another of his favorite themes.~
@19   = ~Do you understand me?~
@20   = ~But I always did, didn't I?~
@21   = ~No. I never understood you.~
@22   = ~To begin with the abstract is all well and good, but I begin to fear you will continue and end with it, and never come to anything else.~
@23   = ~I am listening. Please, continue.~
@24   = ~Yeah, yeah, yeah. So are you going to kiss me or not?~
@25   = ~Indeed? Than you are wiser than me: I am not sure I know myself. Watch closely as I unravel this tangled skein.~
@26   = ~Then we are two of a kind, love. But perhaps... listen. I will do my best to explain.~
@27   = ~(sigh) Please, only be patient a little longer.~
@28   = ~If a man told you, then, that he cared nothing for life, would you expect him to cling to it like a demented miser to his purse? But that is exactly what I have done. If I truly believed, in my heart, that we are doomed, would I have seen fit to harp on the idea so ceaselessly?~
@29   = ~No - that is my secret. I am not a strong man. I am a great coward.~
@30   = ~If we are truly doomed, and life is truly as empty as I suspect, then there is nothing for it but to commit hopelessly to your arms forever.~
@31   = ~Gee, how romantic. Not.~
@32   = ~Hmph. I am not even asked, I presume.~
@33   = ~So? What are you waiting for?!~
@34   = ~You dare? After everything you have done to me?~
@35   = ~You are right to take offense, I suppose. But if you were short of patience - would you have followed me this far? You have always known the sort of man I am.~
@36   = ~Because I am not brave enough.~
@37   = ~I am a man of great audacity. The reckless and wretched always are.~
@38   = ~But wait - I have not finished. Only a little, a little longer, I swear...~
@39   = ~I have lived this sorry life expecting to die at any moment - expecting everything I cared for to be torn from me at any moment. And much of it has. But now, we have come this far - so very far indeed - and I find that much of it has not. You are still with me. But I am not still... I am not still with you.~
@40   = ~If I were a man of faith - I mean if I believed the gods took a greater part in our lives than I suspect they do - then I might be forced to conclude, that with their famously wicked sense of humor, they have resolved to teach me a lesson. I expect you to wilt like a flower - but here you stand before me. More powerful. More radiant. More - beautiful than ever.~
@41   = ~You have won many enemies - but many admirers as well. And I am among them...~
@42   = ~Eh, Xan, are you sure you don't want to return to discussing philosophy?~
@43   = ~You almost sound as if you still loved me, Xan.~
@44   = ~I fear I am losing the thread of your rambling. You have a point, I suppose?~
@45   = ~I see where it is going. Xan, I am sorry, but - should I continue? I do not love you.~
@46   = ~You sorely tempt me, <CHARNAME>. But no.~
@47   = ~I never stopped loving you. You knew that.~
@48   = ~I - I did not.~
@49   = ~Ah-ha!~
@50   = ~Oh, of course. Every time I cried in my pillow, I repeated to myself: "But he loves me!". Xan, are you sure you have a brain in this head of yours?~
@51   = ~I suspected, but it was too good to be true... and you never showed me...~
@52   = ~It is a tired theme, <CHARNAME>, but I must repeat it. Do we ever hurt those for whom we care nothing?~
@53   = ~Yes, at the bottom of things I am quite wretched, aren't I? But I am doing my best... to show you now what I really feel. For better or for worse.~
@54   = ~Now perhaps my tedious argument reaches its theme at last. If I had believed life to be as hollow as that ancient philosophical tyrant has taught us, I would not have behaved as I did. But if I believed it to have - in your person, <CHARNAME> - the slightest scrap of meaning - of joy - of hope for a better day - then to act as I did would not have been only folly. It would have been the foulest treason.~
@55   = ~I have no cause to believe we will not lie in our graves tomorrow. I have no reason to believe there will be ever be a recompense for this life of suffering. I have no reason to believe that there could be. But if there is - if there is...~ [O#XAN269]
@56   = ~<CHARNAME>. Let the past depart. Let the dead bury their dead. Let whatever was said be forgotten. Together we may stand or fall, but alone we are sure to fall. Hold me. Kiss me. Because I can't, I can't - ~ [O#XAN270]
@57   = ~Xan...~
@58   = ~(You silently put your arms around Xan.)~
@59   = ~(You kiss Xan firmly on the lips.)~
@60   = ~Xan, I thank you for your candor, but this is all very sudden. I need some time to think the matter over.~
@61   = ~Xan, I thank you for your candor. And I am sorry. But, to put it plainly - you have had your chance.~
@62   = ~(At some length, gently, Xan embraces you and kisses your forehead, your cheek, the tip of your nose, each eyelid.)~
@63   = ~(Xan fiercely returns your embrace.)~
@64   = ~Ah-mm, <CHARNAME> I - I, <CHARNAME>, I - mmh-mphh-phm-~
@65   = ~Then you understand me - or out of love, you are willing to pretend as if you do. Ha! What does it matter? Nothing I have said is of any value beside this embrace. This is all I care about. All in all.~
@66   = ~Oh - of course! Take all the time in the world. We have all the time in the world.~
@67   = ~But gods, it feels so good to speak my mind...~
@68   = ~I... you... <CHARNAME>?~
@69   = ~But I should have expected this.~
@70   = ~No. Don't get up.~ [O#XAN203]
@71   = ~I have been watching you sleep, for... for the better part of the night, I suppose. It felt like I had two or more hearts fluttering in my chest - or, rather, all over my body. (sigh) In all my years, I have never experienced anything even remotely close... but listen.~
@72   = ~Soon, the day will begin. There may be treachery. There may be dying. There will certainly be killing. It has begun already, I suppose: but we'll cheat. We'll pretend it hasn't.~
@73   = ~Look at you now. Who would ever believe you had so much blood on your hands? ... Forgive me, do forgive me. I don't mean to reproach you, least of all now. There is blood on my hands as well: see? The blood of men. The blood of things other than men. And yet at the moment I can almost find it - to be happy.~
@74   = ~Oh, naught but the usual - the smell of the morning air. Your face.~
@75   = ~Sleep.~
@76   = ~I won't tell! You first.~
@77   = ~What else? The specter looming over us all: my imminent destiny. Look in my face - can't you see it?~
@78   = ~It is morning, Xan. You know I can't string eight words... what was I talking about?~
@79   = ~(groan) Really, now. I'd like to believe I never flattered you so transparently.~
@80   = ~Oh, you are cruel, <CHARNAME>. Hah, very well...~
@81   = ~Ha! Ha. Do not worry yourself, few men can string eight sensible words together at the best of times. That is no matter.~
@82   = ~Truly? Well, perhaps it is best if you doze through what I have to say. I imagine I'll bore you thoroughly.~
@83   = ~I look in your face and see only light and sweetness - it is only these poor eyes of mine I am speaking of, you understand. The moment they communicate this impression to my mind, I feel in every fiber of my being that I must be either mad or a fool.~
@84   = ~Yet I suppose you know what I'm about to say. If this is madness, I rather prefer it to that tiresome thing they call sanity; and if it is folly, well, I have always suspected that everything is folly, and this folly at least is kind.~
@85   = ~Huh?~
@86   = ~It's alright, you know. You can simply say 'I love you.'~
@87   = ~Mmm... Go on, please.~
@88   = ~(sigh) Yes, I suppose your reply is quite apt.~
@89   = ~Ah, <CHARNAME>... If I could 'simply say' anything, you know I would not be myself.~
@90   = ~Yes, I am sure these clumsy intimations of affection are nothing like the true outpouring you desire, and deserve. But I am yours: and you will have to bear with me.~
@91   = ~Shall I? I feel as if I go on at too great a length already: it is so much easier to talk about love than to be a true and faithful lover.~
@92   = ~But if you wish. That face of yours - that unformed morning face, that expectant cast, that sloppy sweetness - there I see, with no pretense, so much beauty that it seems incredible it could exist anywhere in this pigsty of a world, let alone that I could possess it.~
@93   = ~The fact of the matter is, I can hardly bear to look for long. Because I feel this - really it is horrid, don't laugh - this horrid sort of melting sensation, and all of a sudden it is all can manage to keep from uttering the most dreadful blasphemies - such as, "we are surely not doomed," or perhaps "life is full to the cusp with goodness."~
@94   = ~Terrifying, don't you agree?~
@95   = ~You don't say.~
@96   = ~Oh, I can think of several worse fates.~
@97   = ~Really, Xan. I understand that I love the man you are, but would it would cripple you to be the slightest bit more - demonstrative?~
@98   = ~There's something frightening about it, the idea that you might become a different person - even if it seems to be for the best.~
@99   = ~Precisely. What happens to the original person? And I suppose that you would know all this quite well, <CHARNAME>.~
@100  = ~Demonstrative? Oh, I am demonstrating something, alright - the problem is in my heart, not my head. I am being quite eloquent about my paltry feelings, believe me.~
@101  = ~To think that I may have been mistaken for so long, about so many things - not that I do believe it yet, but even as a possibility. It is indeed frightening. I have never thought of myself as a prideful man, but perhaps, at the end of the day, I have my pride. If I have indeed found something beautiful, something of true worth, I do not know if I am ready to commit my life to it entirely. Some strange, wretched impulse holds me back. A kind of caution. Perhaps a kind of cowardice. Oh, how far my thoughts have strayed from when I merely asked you to lie with me a little longer...~
@102  = ~I feel as if I give you so little. I would like to give everything, if I could. But that would be something really drastic. Something terrible. Do you know what I mean?~
@103  = ~Those fanatical Helmites talk about throwing themselves into the arms of their God. That is really a drastic thought: to throw oneself into a pair of arms one is not even sure are there. I could never do that, I am certain. But I cannot even give myself up to this love of ours - and you are lying here next to me. I can reach out and touch your arm - like so.~
@104  = ~I think that I understand, at least enough to wish I could help. I can't force a thing on your part, but for what it is worth: my heart is open to you.~
@105  = ~But, Xan, you have thrown yourself into my arms. On more than one occasion.~
@106  = ~I want this. You want this. What is the problem?~
@107  = ~What do you mean, give yourself up? I don't understand.~
@108  = ~You are free to come and go however you wish. I do not force anything on you.~
@109  = ~Truly?~
@110  = ~Those words mean something to me. I suppose I should have known all along - your nature is more loving than mine - but it is good to hear, somehow.~
@111  = ~Does my meaning really escape you, or are you making light of me? But this a serious matter.~
@112  = ~Ah, <CHARNAME>, you have always been so - I will not say 'childish' again, I daresay you have had enough of that. You have always been so delightfully clear.~
@113  = ~Perhaps simply because your nature is milder than mine. But because - oh, do you understand - because love comes so grudgingly, so haltingly to mine, when it does come, I am afraid that it must come in this form...~
@114  = ~Say you so? In this whole tale, so fraught with destiny, sacrifice... am I truly free? It does not feel so. Yet indulge me, if you do not feel the same as I do.~
@115  = ~I should know... and yet I hesitate. So what shall I do?~
@116  = ~I nearly lost you, yet you returned to me. I am willing to wait another tenday for perfection.~
@117  = ~Very well, think on it if you must. In the meantime we can allow ourselves to be happy - no?~
@118  = ~Kiss me, you verbose fool.~
@119  = ~Very well. Give your whole heart to me now, this very moment! I challenge you.~
@120  = ~Xan... (sigh) Just tell me what you want.~
@121  = ~From your tone, you seem to laugh at me. But a tenday's wait has that disturbing tendency to become a month, and from thence a year.~
@122  = ~Perhaps. Yet happiness, like so many things, tends to rot - tends to decay. If not looked after. Can one remain just so forever? I don't believe one can. One cannot, after all, remain 'merely alive' forever.~
@123  = ~And now... ?~
@124  = ~I would if I knew, <CHARNAME>. Otherwise why else would I ramble on so?~
@125  = ~Yes... Yes.~
@126  = ~I will do it. I will wager the world, I suppose, but what was the world worth to begin with? I will do it: I have nothing to lose. But there is everything to gain.~
@127  = ~Yet how can one go and do such a thing? I can't carve my heart out of my chest and present it to you... I suppose I could, in fact, but that would do neither of us the slightest good.~
@128  = ~<CHARNAME>, I cannot say how I might prove my love. I know I love you, but I don't know what my love is - what it could mean to you to have more of it, what it means to have the sorry pittance I have given you already. I want to give you something - everything - so I place it all in your hands.~
@129  = ~Tell me what you want me to do. I will do anything you ask, once.~
@130  = ~And before you put the obvious question; yes, even to take my own life. Because I am sure you would not ask that: I would not make the offer if I thought you would.~
@131  = ~Xan, you scare me. Is this really necessary?~
@132  = ~Indeed? And how can you be so sure? Take your own life.~
@133  = ~So, you want to prove your loyalty? Then smash my foes. All of them.~
@134  = ~Ah, I've been waiting for this moment. Hah! Go down on your knees, kiss my foot, and beg forgiveness for having abandoned me before.~
@135  = ~Hold me. Kiss me. Be with me - as you have been before.~
@136  = ~Xan, there is no need. You have given me enough already: you give me more each day.~
@137  = ~Well... will you marry me?~
@138  = ~Ha! You are frightened by this, but not of dragons, liches... ? Perhaps - yes - I feel that this is of the same magnitude. I feel that it is necessary.~
@139  = ~(sigh) Very well, you have called my bluff. But I did not think you would be so frivolous.~
@140  = ~Truly, is that all you can say to me? Do you think so little of me? Ask another thing.~
@141  = ~Indeed, though I suspect you jest, I would if I could. I will fight my best by your side, as I have always.~
@142  = ~<CHARNAME>, I - I...~
@143  = ~I beg your forgiveness. I beg it humbly. I offer no excuse for my behavior; I only throw myself on your mercy. However I have wronged you... I will do my utmost to make up the sum by whatever happiness I might bring to you.~
@144  = ~There, are you satisfied? That was not easy, but... I confess that I feel better.~
@145  = ~I...~
@146  = ~Seldarine, can I really do it? Reach out, touch you... hold you and whisper... It seems like you have granted me my desire, instead.~
@147  = ~I never thought there can be such a thing as too much joy. But there is.~
@148  = ~Come. I will be with you... and your hand will be with me - that is, if you do not mind.~
@149  = ~I... I, ah...~
@150  = ~If...~
@151  = ~When this whole tortured story finally reaches its (surely terrible) finale - if we are not dead, undead, in limbo - if stars still shine in the sky (about which I have grave doubts) - then, yes, <CHARNAME>. If you wish me to, I will.~
@152  = ~So the bargain is sealed, I suppose... ? Then time will tell if it is enough. But I hope - Gods, I pray - that it will be. Come whatever may, I don't want to lose you again.~
@153  = ~Ask, <CHARNAME>, and you shall receive.~
@154  = ~Do you ever wish it could have been different?~ [O#XAN204]
@155  = ~How so?~
@156  = ~Why do you ask?~
@157  = ~Xan, this is neither the time nor the place.~
@158  = ~Quite so. But... oh, never mind.~
@159  = ~I mean with you and I - but I do not mean, do you ever wish it hadn't come to be. I only meant that at last it is, after many trials - second-guessings, sleepless nights, tears, reversals, misunderstandings - we have bought our union at a great price.~
@160  = ~And every night tow-headed youths, heedless, fling themselves into each other's arms, and seem to have happiness - after a fashion. We may delude ourselves to say that their happiness is not as 'deep' or 'true' as ours - yet can we be sure of that?~
@161  = ~I only meant to ask, do you ever wonder? If it might not have been... easier.~
@162  = ~Well, if a certain someone wouldn't have broken up with me earlier, then of course.~
@163  = ~If you were a farmer's son, you mean, and I were a milkmaid? I cannot say I salivate at the prospect.~
@164  = ~I do wish we could have been spared the tears, yes. But what has passed has passed, I suppose.~
@165  = ~No. It is the trials that have made the rewards sweet.~
@166  = ~Ah.~
@167  = ~But of course.~
@168  = ~Me neither, in truth, and I am glad you feel the same. There is a certain solace in being ourselves, no matter what the price.~
@169  = ~Indeed. Nonetheless, better people than ourselves have cause, from time to time, to wonder what might have been.~
@170  = ~Truly, is that what you feel? Then perhaps, if I try, I may feel the same. It is a lofty goal. I do not know if I have reached it yet.~
@171  = ~In truth, I sometimes wonder... if I am not the wrong sort of man for you. You are a rising star, <CHARNAME> - a brilliance that at times puts this whole dreary world to shame. You are painfully young and painfully beautiful. And I am, no matter how many times I successfully defend your life, or if I finally learn to master my cowardice, a rather dismal person.~
@172  = ~Xan, I have known you for some time, and you are neither as cowardly, nor as dismal, as you seem to believe.~
@173  = ~So I would exchange you for some dashing but brainless knight errant? Not a chance, dearest.~
@174  = ~I would have you if you were lame, a madman, or an orc, Xan. It is you I love.~
@175  = ~In case it escaped your notice, Xan, I myself am not the type to skip through meadows.~
@176  = ~Err...'opposites attract'?~
@177  = ~Indeed? But alas, I know myself. If only I could believe you.~
@178  = ~But perhaps I do. Perhaps, by now, I do... perhaps after all, I was only baiting a compliment. Forgive me, <CHARNAME>.~
@179  = ~No, you are not, forgive me... perhaps it is only beside myself that you often, to me, seem bright and cheery. Ah, <CHARNAME>...~
@180  = ~Perhaps so. Yes, such a saying is well in order with the mad, paradoxical, even perverse shape of the universe that I apprehend. Ah, <CHARNAME>...~
@181  = ~They say that the words of repentance precede the feeling, and this is surely the case. I said I was sorry for my abandonment, but only now do I truly feel sorry - every moment, every time that I look at you. I have sinned against you - I have sinned against beauty, and love. And for that matter, it was not the first time. But it is only now that I begin to feel it.~
@182  = ~Would I exchange this pain for any shallow pleasure? I like to think that I would not. Yet always, there is the temptation - to wish that the world were perfect, or at least of the shallow, ultimately worthless perfection that your feeble mortal minds can conceive.~
@183  = ~Perhaps that is it. I could have imagined any number of maudlin romantic scenarios. But I could never have imagined you.~
@184  = ~Here's a quote from the Elven annals that might catch your fancy: "The fact of our deaths is certain. Only the hour is uncertain."~ [O#XAN205]
@185  = ~Well, it's good to see you in your... usual form, I suppose.~
@186  = ~My thoughts precisely.~
@187  = ~Again with our deaths! Xan, don't you ever think about - rabbits? Or the lilies of the field?~
@188  = ~Indeed? I fear I have a become as much an influence on you, <CHARNAME>, as you have been on my unfortunate self.~
@189  = ~In truth, whether you believe me or no, my thoughts were moving in a somewhat lighter direction.~
@190  = ~After all, since the hour is known to no man - we must pass the time somehow, must we not?~
@191  = ~Mm. And what, precisely, did you have in mind?~
@192  = ~So, since life is futile, we should at least make the most of it? This is your new tune?~
@193  = ~Xan, love, we really do not have the time for your ramblings at the moment.~
@194  = ~It was the theme of my thoughts, in fact, to wonder what you had in mind.~
@195  = ~Tune? Ah, as ever, you would make light of me.~
@196  = ~Very well. Perhaps another day, then... that is, if we live to see it?~
@197  = ~I think of the future. An unfamiliar habit, and perhaps unwise - but when I think of it, my thoughts are not so dark as you might suppose. Whether there is to be a future is another matter entirely. That there may not be - well, hah, I believe you know my thoughts on the subject. Yet, if there is... we will have some freedom, yes? And perhaps some happiness.~
@198  = ~Perhaps... if we are true to each other, as it seems we are learning to be.~
@199  = ~Perhaps... if you do not callously abandon me yet again.~
@200  = ~Perhaps... if you will be satisfied with my imperfect self.~
@201  = ~No, in all likelihood we are doomed.~
@202  = ~Freedom? Yes, when I ascend to godhood. I will have freedom, then, though I cannot speak for you.~
@203  = ~Yes, indeed. Experience, I believe it was said, is a dear school; yet fools will learn in no other.~
@204  = ~Ah, dear... I thought we had put the matter behind us. Yet I suppose we can never put it fully behind us. I can make no promises, I am afraid, but I... I will do my best never again to wound you so deeply.~
@205  = ~Imperfect? I believe that I, in my own imperfection, will be more than satisfied.~
@206  = ~Hah! Again you mock. Oh, dear... we know each other too well, I suppose.~
@207  = ~So, in spite of certain monstrous shadows looming in front of us, we spy a distant future. What do you think it will look like?~
@208  = ~Wealth, riches, power... you and I on our thrones, in some palace... servants at our beck and call...~
@209  = ~A wood cabin, perhaps... you on the porch, whittling a pipe from a branch... myself in the kitchen, boiling potatoes...~
@210  = ~A life of adventure! On and on, without end... how else could I be content?~
@211  = ~Xan, what if... what if, in the end, I do wish to claim my heritage?~
@212  = ~I do not know. I do admit a certain difficulty in seeing past these 'monstrous shadows', when they are threatening to kill me at every turn.~
@213  = ~I do not know. In fact, I was rather hoping that you would set our course - it would be a relief, after all this time, to put the matter in someone else's hands.~
@214  = ~<CHARNAME>... no. Do not even speak of such things. We have not discussed the matter, and I wish it to remain that way.~
@215  = ~You see, the choice is yours. Entirely yours. Do you understand that? I may advise, and I have already. We may all advise, and have, and will; but in the end the choice will be yours. Am I afraid that you will make the wrong choice, both for yourself and for others? Of course... I cannot lie. But I cannot decide what is only yours to decide. I do not want to speak of it anymore.~
@216  = ~Until then... ?~
@217  = ~Well, until then, you are with us, and I suppose we should make much of our time.~
@218  = ~Oh dear. Are you jesting, <CHARNAME>? You would turn up your nose at divine power, only to covet all the world? But if that is what makes you happy, I am blessedly indifferent. So long as we do not step on too many toes.~
@219  = ~Oh dear. Are you jesting, <CHARNAME>? Does the heart of a mere domestic truly beat in that valiant breast? Though I confess... the thought is not entirely unappealing.~
@220  = ~You may imagine that I am less than amenable to this idea.~
@221  = ~Yet there is something in that simple phrase that tugs at my heart - 'forever and ever.' Ah, my darling <CHARNAME>, don't you know that nothing is forever? Some day, even before our deaths, I believe we may have to hang up our swords. But if that is what you wish, to travel these dangerous roads a while longer, then perhaps I could see myself traveling on by your side...~
@222  = ~That is quite fair. For my part, I certainly find it difficult to imagine - which is why, I suppose, I deferred to you.~
@223  = ~Children?~
@224  = ~Perhaps in time, if the brats will behave themselves.~
@225  = ~Xan! I-I'm a bit caught off-guard. I haven't thought that far...~
@226  = ~Oh yes. Two, perhaps. Or three. Or four.~
@227  = ~But of course! As many as possible - I love the dears.~
@228  = ~Under no circumstances. Have you lost your mind?~
@229  = ~My thoughts precisely. I don't imagine I would be an exemplary father, so it is more for their theoretical sakes that I worry.~
@230  = ~Indeed: perhaps, then, we should end our speculations here? After all - hah - it may well come to nothing. Yet it is not altogether unpleasant to consider. Is it?~
@231  = ~Truly? Have you considered, <CHARNAME>, what sort of parents we are likely to be?~
@232  = ~Hah! My, but the lady knows her mind. Yet I suppose you know that bearing children is less pleasant, by far, than raising them. Or so I am told.~
@233  = ~But there is something incredible about the thought, isn't there? A tiny being, alive, that springs from our lives. Is such a thing even possible?~
@234  = ~In all my years, I may never have considered it...~
@235  = ~But this is all a daydream. I apologize - how unlike me. I suppose it is bad enough to become attached to these impermanent things in our hands right now, let alone some distant vision.~
@236  = ~Nonetheless...~
@237  = ~Ah, <CHARNAME>.~
@238  = ~Well, here we are at last. There draws an end to everything, doesn't there?~ [O#XAN206]
@239  = ~An end to everything? Ominous words, I think.~
@240  = ~An end for my foes, perhaps. For myself, this is to be only the beginning.~
@241  = ~Yes, an end; and perhaps it is for the best. Myself, I feel a certain - rightness.~
@242  = ~Oh, am I to face my destiny at last? After such striving, so many trials? Does the fate of Faerun rest squarely on my shoulders? My thanks, Xan, that fact had slipped my notice entirely.~
@243  = ~Are they? No doubt they are what you would expect from me. But perhaps, this time, I do not mean them in the usual sense.~
@244  = ~One can only hope, I suppose. Yet every beginning is an end as well: every birth a death.~
@245  = ~Truly? That was my thought, as well.~
@246  = ~Ha! Well matched, my pretty, witty one. But I have more to say.~
@247  = ~I feel a rightness. That - in spite of the trials - something fundamental has gone right. Unlike myself, I know. Yet perhaps, after all, something has changed...~
@248  = ~Xan! I am utterly shocked.~
@249  = ~Changed, eh? You? I bet it won't last.~
@250  = ~Yes! I knew you'd see the light eventually. But it took a bit of work, let me tell you.~
@251  = ~Look, over there! Is that a flying pig I see?~
@252  = ~Don't misunderstand me: I have no more faith in your eventual triumph than ever. Nor has the happiness of your embrace somehow banished every other misery that still remains in this world; nor I have come to have faith in your guiding star, or in the beneficence of these meddling human gods... No.~
@253  = ~Yet somehow it has pleased the gods to spare me thus far. And there has been much pain - but much joy, as well. I have seen so much of the Realms, and I have seen much misery and much evil; yet some desperate, tentative good, as well. I have lost your love, but I have found it again. And now that I reflect on in it all... I want to laugh. Do you understand me?~
@254  = ~Well, I am glad that my desperate struggle for survival has amused you so.~
@255  = ~No, I do not. But then again, when did I ever?~
@256  = ~Yes... I think that I do.~
@257  = ~Ah, <CHARNAME>. Forgive me.~
@258  = ~Existence no longer seems cruel to me. It seems strange, perhaps. And at times it seems awful, and at times it almost begins to seem magnificent. It is like a sort of great symphony, incomprehensible to our ears - except that now and again, perhaps, especially with fools like us, who have been destined to play such dire parts, for a moment we may comprehend the whole. And the more I hear, the more I am amazed. It stops my powers of speech.~
@259  = ~It may be that I will always strike a sour note. And it may be that you will always play the same complex, beguiling, impossible tune, until the hour of your death - or your ascension. But perhaps, in the end, that is all that falls to our lot - to play the part assigned to us, as well as we can.~
@260  = ~That's nice. I like that.~
@261  = ~As well as can be expected, I suppose.~
@262  = ~A pretty speech, I suppose, but what is it to do with you and me?~
@263  = ~That's very nice, Xan, but - we really haven't time to go into all this right now.~
@264  = ~As for you and I, <CHARNAME>... the more we talk, the less I feel I have to say. This is what it all comes down to. In the face of the universe, in the face of everything good and bad - and if you will have me - I will stand by you. Until the very end.~
@265  = ~And I will have you, Xan. Forever and ever.~
@266  = ~Thank you, dear.~
@267  = ~Took you long enough, didn't it?~
@268  = ~Indeed? It seemed to me that the time was right to say a word or two. But if that is what you wish. I suppose there was never much need for words between us, not that you would know it from the way we prattle on.~
@269  = ~Just know that I am with you, whatever might come.~
@270  = ~And ever. And ever. And ever. Words I previously could not have imagined referring to anything other than our deaths.~
@271  = ~Very well, <CHARNAME>. Then let us do what has to be done, and come what may. I do not care what happens now: if I am cast into hell, I have still found my paradise.~
@272  = ~Do you remember the Nashkel Mines? And myself, grubby and starved, in a pit? Ye gods... the sentiment nearly overwhelms me. Quickly, <CHARNAME>, tell me that life is futile; I fear I am dangerously close to tears. And not from sorrow.~
@273  = ~My friend... do we have time to talk?~ [O#XAN207]
@274  = ~I suppose so. Why?~
@275  = ~And what do you have to say?~
@276  = ~Yes, I think we should. Before you keep your word and abandon me right here, that is.~
@277  = ~Perhaps another time, Xan.~
@278  = ~I am not going to, you know this. Not any longer.~
@279  = ~As you will. Allow me to say just that, though.~
@280  = ~We face difficult and dangerous time ahead. You need every ounce of help you can get - but, alas, you cannot trust just anyone. Past events proved that.~
@281  = ~I do not know if, here and now, you trust me. But know this: for every little doubt I had about you and your heritage, for every hasty word I might have said before, for my ignoble behavior and for my foolish desire to leave you on the cobblestones of Amn - I apologize.~
@282  = ~Whatever happens, I am loyal to you. Not because of temptations you resisted, or your general good nature - or great deeds you are famous for. Simply because of you. Just in the name of our friendship. Until the end.~
@283  = ~So you say, so it will be.~
@284  = ~Oooh, what a speech! I am impressed.~
@285  = ~I accept your pledge, my knight. You may rise, Sir Xan.~
@286  = ~I hate to disappoint you, Xan, but I am not a paragon of virtue.~
@287  = ~Uh-huh. And tomorrow, you'll say there's no point in all this carnage, pick up your backpack and head for Evereska.~
@288  = ~What about your moonblade, then? I thought it could kill you for helping a Child of Bhaal.~
@289  = ~Then I am content. No matter, Five, or Fifty Five - we stand united.~
@290  = ~(sigh) You jest, as always. But it's strangely comforting... you know?~
@291  = ~Oh, I know that. Still, I cannot say you are a <MANWOMAN> of infamy, either. Not every villain saves an entire elven city, or destroys a nest of powerful vampires. Motives play a part, yes... but sometimes, result is everything.~
@292  = ~Do you truly have so little trust in me? No. Not if my life depended on it.~
@293  = ~I... thought so, too.~
@294  = ~And then I thought: to hell with it.~
@295  = ~Irenicus is dead. Even now, messengers are on their way to Evereska and the isle of Evermeet: these are crucial news. Elvendom is safe... for now. And I, its defender, find nothing better to do than to march out, protecting my friend, a possible future Dark <LADYLORD>, at that. A nifty mission to fulfill, isn't it?~
@296  = ~Yesss... You are doomed, Xan.~
@297  = ~Indeed. I wonder what is to happen to you, if I do win this war.~
@298  = ~I marvel at your courage.~
@299  = ~You know, perhaps you really should head home. It is dangerous.~
@300  = ~Oh, we will die and no mistake.~
@301  = ~They say it is better to die standing than to die regretting. I regret many things, but I know I will not regret today.~
@302  = ~Nothing good, I'll wager. But we shall see, won't we? I only pray we have time to see.~
@303  = ~And I marvel at yours. You know we are going to war, don't you? But you continue.~
@304  = ~As always, though.~
@305  = ~I thought so, once. And then I wanted to say the same to you, to send *you* home.~
@306  = ~But you have none, and mine will not open its doors to you. And even if you had one, I do not think you would have waited there idly.~
@307  = ~So - no. I stay, my friend. I stay.~
@308  = ~Ah, my influence, I see. It is good to see our friendship is not one-sided, at least. Well - shall we?~
@309  = ~No rest, no sleep, and no escape for a tormented soul, eh?~ [O#XAN208]
@310  = ~You don't say. Dragons and giants every day... (yawn) I am bored.~
@311  = ~Xan! It is not a joking matter.~
@312  = ~Yeah! Let us start the eternal whine "When will we get some peace and quiet?" You first.~
@313  = ~I am fine. How are you?~
@314  = ~Yes, it was much more exciting when we had to stop for a few nights, because a kobold gravely injured half of the party. Or during that unforgettable time that I spent in Mulahey's company.~
@315  = ~Heavens, is this time really over?~
@316  = ~Is it? But everything is a joking matter. In this petty world, where the sole reality is death - is there really anything you could forbid yourself to laugh about?~
@317  = ~Oh, <CHARNAME>... you will be surprised.~
@318  = ~I'll live. If someone will get me a healer in time, that is. But as of yet, I have started to experience the most peculiar feeling...~
@319  = ~I am bored. Life was hollow before - but it held death and danger. Every day was the last one, and every day, I faced choices upon choices. Life was a deathly game - but exciting, at that.~
@320  = ~I do not long for peace and quiet: I have found it. In your face, in your company, I have a banner. After so many victories, I know that you were born a winner, so I am no longer afraid for my well-being. Here I am safer than anywhere. Life is dull.~
@321  = ~What is it like for you, <CHARNAME>? You are one of the most powerful beings in this world. Do you still find interest in laughing, crying, loving, making choices? In simple things?~
@322  = ~I still can laugh, as you may have heard, and I enjoy it.~
@323  = ~Xan, ALL other Children of Bhaal are after me! I feel very much alive and hunted, thank you!~
@324  = ~Of course. It is wonderful to be alive.~
@325  = ~Everything seems empty. I no longer feel any excitement.~
@326  = ~I love. That says it all, really.~
@327  = ~Indeed? I salute you, then.~
@328  = ~Ah, that. Why, yes. Very much so. And they hunt *me*, as well - how could I have forgotten?~
@329  = ~As well as I do. But imagine: imagine you did. Can you?~
@330  = ~I believe so.~
@331  = ~I could try, I suppose.~
@332  = ~What for?~
@333  = ~I do not think so.~
@334  = ~Excellent.~
@335  = ~You know what they say about advising others being easier than helping yourself? Try it on me, will you? Who knows, it may help yourself in the long run.~
@336  = ~Perhaps you will have a piece of advice for me? We are both in the same circumstances: our abilities have grown beyond measure during the past year, but our minds and emotions remain the same; and while you still see some sense in this life, it becomes duller for me with every passing day. Advise me, <CHARNAME>.~
@337  = ~Treasure every day as if it was the last one. You will learn.~
@338  = ~Just look around. Feel love, pleasure, curiosity - you can do it.~
@339  = ~We have a quest, Xan: to stop the Five. Work towards this goal.~
@340  = ~What can I advise you? You are a grown man, much as I am.~
@341  = ~I do not think I can.~
@342  = ~I've no desire to. Deal with your problems yourself.~
@343  = ~Will I? Ah, but each day is the same, and there is no escape from this monotony. But perhaps... if I was to die tomorrow...~
@344  = ~... And I may die tomorrow, of course. Easily so. Yes, <CHARNAME>, there is wisdom in your words. My eyes see, my hands move... (sigh)... Fabulous.~
@345  = ~Let us go. I need time to treasure this feeling.~
@346  = ~And - thank you.~
@347  = ~Where? Who will love me - a mortal woman, who stands many steps below me? My equal, who should be equally bored by now? How will I feel curiosity, having seen everything? How am I supposed to feel *joy*, of all things - among corpses? Are you mocking me?~
@348  = ~... Forgive me. Of course, this is what you feel - and rightly feel, I doubt it not. Well, perhaps with time I will sense it, too, if indeed joy and love exist for ones as powerful as we.~
@349  = ~We shall. I will be free, but serving Evereska will claim my life within days, no doubt.~
@350  = ~Ah, the familiar sense of being irrevocably doomed... and I feel almost alive again. Thank you, my friend.~
@351  = ~But what if you could, <CHARNAME>? Imagine you were an everseeing god - not unlike Helm, perhaps. Wouldn't you advise your faithful servant?~
@352  = ~But this is pure blasphemy. I apologize. (sigh) Perhaps some other god will answer my prayer? I don't know...~
@353  = ~Of course. What else should I have expected for a true, devoted friend?~
@354  = ~It is all so easy... money, power... what is left to desire? What is your heart's desire now, <CHARNAME>?~ [O#XAN209]
@355  = ~More of it, I suppose. The sky is the limit.~
@356  = ~Everything.~
@357  = ~I want to keep and preserve my love.~
@358  = ~To live forever.~
@359  = ~To be left alone. This is all I ask for.~
@360  = ~Peace.~
@361  = ~I do not desire anything. I have it all.~
@362  = ~When you have everything, the only thing that is left to desire is nothing, <CHARNAME>. Do you wish to enter the oblivion so?~
@363  = ~I want to be a god.~
@364  = ~Perhaps. Why not?~
@365  = ~It is natural to wish for more money and power.~
@366  = ~One can never have everything. I simply want more.~
@367  = ~Ah. I see. That is, you no longer want to be yourself.~
@368  = ~I do not understand. I will never understand, I suppose.~
@369  = ~Is it natural, though? I understand that you feel contentment after acquiring one thing or another, but for how long? And when all treasures of the Realms lie in your chests, and the best swordarms and spellslingers have yielded to you, what will you feel? What is the point of having - simply to have?~
@370  = ~I don't understand.~
@371  = ~An admirable goal indeed. How do you see your future, then?~
@372  = ~Just the pair of us, together. Anywhere.~
@373  = ~A house, a few children, a dog barking... or a cat, curled in front of a fireplace.~
@374  = ~Romantic dinners, flowers, stars - you know how it goes.~
@375  = ~Ah. I am ashamed to admit this, but you are making me rather envious. I wish you both luck, my friend.~
@376  = ~I wonder if your children will carry the blood of Bhaal, and thus, will be in as much danger as you. They might. But all we can do on that account is to wait and see, I believe. Who knows, perhaps there is a solution in store.~
@377  = ~Making merry, yes. So, love is all about entertainment for you, eh? Interesting.~
@378  = ~(sigh) I can just imagine the amount of carnage you would bring if you had forever. But of course, with your frighteningly finite life, you would want to have more. Do you have any plans? Eternity, as they say, is a long time.~
@379  = ~Not really. It is just - between life and death, I choose life.~
@380  = ~Every day, I can turn to dust! What plans are you talking about?~
@381  = ~A few.~
@382  = ~Oh, yes. Many, many wonderful plans.~
@383  = ~Of course. I imagine anyone would have wanted the same in your place.~
@384  = ~(sigh) I am sorry, <CHARNAME>. I am sorry.~
@385  = ~I see. Hopefully your life will not be as hollow as mine.~
@386  = ~Ah, the eternal dream. Peace and quiet. We are very alike in this, my friend. Although now, I do not know. I imagine myself all alone, somewhere in a cabin among woods and glades - and I do not want this. Do you? Do you really?~
@387  = ~Oh, yes. More than want.~
@388  = ~I do.~
@389  = ~Now that you say this, I don't know.~
@390  = ~No... probably not. I will think on this.~
@391  = ~Clearly, you need some peace. Not the most convenient desire in the heart of the unraveling war, is it? But who knows. Perhaps some distant day...~
@392  = ~Think, then. Perhaps, if we have time, we will discuss it later. But then again, when did we ever have time?~
@393  = ~Admirable. So, you are content?~
@394  = ~Yes.~
@395  = ~Not really, but it could be worse.~
@396  = ~No, I am not.~
@397  = ~You know what you want, and you have it. Again, it is admirable.~
@398  = ~I suppose.~
@399  = ~You do not wish for anything and you are not content? Is this truly what you think?~
@400  = ~Perhaps it would be better if we talked another time.~
@401  = ~You are luckier than me, in a way: I have no idea what I want. Probably I want to return to Evereska, but the return will be bittersweet. No one will welcome me at its gates, and here, I will lose friends.~
@402  = ~You may stay here, with me. New adventures await us.~
@403  = ~You don't have to leave for Evereska, you know.~
@404  = ~Evereska is your home. And who knows, perhaps you will be more welcome than you think.~
@405  = ~I'd like to visit Candlekeep, myself.~
@406  = ~I really do not care for your plans, Xan.~
@407  = ~Oh, but you may have other plans. Starting with - no, we really shouldn't speak about that, should we? Nobody knows what awaits you at the end of your path.~
@408  = ~So be it.~
@409  = ~I know the feeling. Our old homes have this enchanting grace that draws us again and again. Candlekeep, Evereska - they may lie in ruins, they may be at war, but we are sated with the majestic power of their names alone.~
@410  = ~Aren't we?~
@411  = ~Oh, in this we are very much alike. I look forward to the end of this saga, and what happens then - well, what happens then? I do not care.~
@412  = ~Come, then. We've still a lot to see.~
@413  = ~Power is loneliness. What will I do, once I get back in Evereska?~ [O#XAN210]
@414  = ~It is up to you to decide.~
@415  = ~As if I knew. What will *I* do?~
@416  = ~Evereska, Evereska... When will your laments end?~
@417  = ~Finally marry, hopefully.~
@418  = ~Evereska could use a mage like you.~
@419  = ~I know, I know. I just do not see what to decide. It is not easy, you see.~
@420  = ~You? Do you want to talk about it?~
@421  = ~They are not going to. Imagine that you had seen nothing but Candlekeep for several decades, then went off adventuring, but kept returning to Candlekeep every year. Gorion would be there... and your friends... and perhaps your real parents. Would you ever want to leave it - for good? I did.~
@422  = ~Ah, you always think in the same direction. <CHARNAME>, <CHARNAME> - why would I want to? Do you truly know me so little?~
@423  = ~Why wouldn't you? It's all good, isn't it?~
@424  = ~So, do you have... difficulties?~
@425  = ~It is your choice, certainly.~
@426  = ~I don't know about you, but I think I would be better off married.~
@427  = ~It certainly is, for some. For me, though...~
@428  = ~Oh, I do.~
@429  = ~Yes, it is, and I have already made it. My answer is no.~
@430  = ~You certainly seem popular. I, though...~
@431  = ~It takes time for someone to grow on you. But as for me, I feel it would take eternity. And marrying without passion, without love - marrying a stranger, for that matter - is grossly unfair.~
@432  = ~I am one of the most powerful mages in the Realms... Seldarine, my head spins so fast every time I say these words. I never expected that. Still, I suppose you are correct. This is my duty.~
@433  = ~I know it will feel unbelievable just to be home. To touch the porch with numb fingers, to drink from an old fountain with hungry lips, to smile to children who were born before I left. I know I am in love with my city.~
@434  = ~But I have changed, <CHARNAME>. I have changed so drastically that I am not sure there is even a place for me there anymore. I am no longer worried if I am wanted - I am worried whether Evereska is what I want.~
@435  = ~What do you want instead? Traveling?~
@436  = ~Perhaps it is not. What is it, then?~
@437  = ~Do you prefer staying in my company, then?~
@438  = ~I do not see anything that suits you better than going home, to be honest.~
@439  = ~But you know the answer. I don't know.~
@440  = ~I suppose I would enjoy that for a while, but we are destined to go our separate ways, aren't we? Alaundo's prophecies are bound to be fulfilled.~
@441  = ~Do you mean to say that I am good for nothing? Why, thank you.~
@442  = ~What is it that you are going to do, <CHARNAME>? We talked about your heart's desire, but what about your plans? Simple plans of a simple <MANWOMAN>?~
@443  = ~Imagine the war is over, and you are still yourself. Not an offspring of a dead god, not a mad godling - you. What is your first urge?~
@444  = ~To kiss my lover, wish you all well, and head towards some quiet town.~
@445  = ~To say goodbyes and split loot.~
@446  = ~To celebrate, of course!~
@447  = ~To mourn the fallen in this war.~
@448  = ~To seek adventures!~
@449  = ~Wait-wait-wait. If I do not become a god, what is the whole point?~
@450  = ~You are a romantic, <CHARNAME>. I envy you a little, I admit.~
@451  = ~So banal? I would give you all I own just to have a chance to meet again, and you only care about monetary values?~
@452  = ~But I apologize: once again, my temper got the better of me. Your desire is only natural. After all, most ties, friendly and otherwise, are made through debts and monetary obligations. You will cut them, and set us free... in a way.~
@453  = ~Ah. Your words, so eager - forgive me, my friend - reminded me of your very first celebration in Nashkel. Shortly after Mulahey was killed, and Nashkel mines cleaned, the mayor prepared a grand one for us all. I remember the day fondly.~
@454  = ~Yes... yes, indeed. So young, many of them...~
@455  = ~(sigh)~
@456  = ~<CHARNAME>, you are insufferable. Adventures, adventures - you will get yourself killed one day, mark my words.~
@457  = ~(sigh) Your sense of humor disturbs me. <CHARNAME>, you do not want this. Trust me.~
@458  = ~It is nice to dream and feel this dream may come true, does it not? We have come a long way. Perhaps... perhaps soon, you will face the day free of the Bhaalspawn taint? Or perhaps one day, I will say a prayer at your grave.~
@459  = ~Regardless, I have faith that soon, it will be over. Which is good, I suppose, one way or another. Come, let us do all we can before the world ends.~
@460  = ~So, Ravager is dead. It is almost over.~ [O#XAN211]
@461  = ~Almost. Melissan remains.~
@462  = ~Finally!~
@463  = ~For Melissan, it is.~
@464  = ~Over? No. It is only the beginning.~
@465  = ~But can we be so sure?~
@466  = ~There is a solid chance Melissan will kill you in a not-so-honest battle. Unlike you, she has nothing and no one to lose, but everything to gain. So, there is a chance you will never see the sun again.~
@467  = ~Yes, yes, yes. We're all doomed.~
@468  = ~Is there any point in your words, Xan?~
@469  = ~Why do I even bother fighting her? I can as well lie down and die.~
@470  = ~A very slight one. We are well-prepared and strong.~
@471  = ~Right is on our side. We will win.~
@472  = ~(sigh) <CHARNAME>. I am not jesting, and you are wrong if you truly think we are that stronger.~
@473  = ~Yes, yes, Xan wouldn't be Xan if he didn't warn me. Now what?~
@474  = ~What is it, then?~
@475  = ~Xan, I am going to see Melissan in a few minutes! There is no time! Speak up!~
@476  = ~Uh-huh.~
@477  = ~I am honestly going to tell you what I think, but there will be little point if all I am to hear in return are gibes.~
@478  = ~I worry. We are here, ready for the last step, the last battle, but even here and now we can fall. And it will be especially ironic, will it not?~
@479  = ~I have been trying to find words to caution you, or at least to remind you of the danger, but all words seem small and useless. There is nothing I can say.~
@480  = ~So why have you started this?~
@481  = ~Thank you anyway, Xan. I value your advice.~
@482  = ~I wouldn't have listened, so do not worry.~
@483  = ~Then let us finish this conversation.~
@484  = ~This is a relief. But no; there is something else.~
@485  = ~Oh, I knew you would say this. But often you behaved much nobler than your words led me to believe.~
@486  = ~There is something I should say. After all, today we are to die or to part, aren't we?~
@487  = ~We have come a long way together. There are words people say to judge others: good, evil, noble, cowardly, brash, thoughtful - but I will not. You have done many things, not all of which I can approve. But for me, you will remain a humane, bright person and a close friend. A <BROTHERSISTER> in arms.~
@488  = ~Thank you.~
@489  = ~You are very welcome.~
@490  = ~Thank you. Your words matter to me.~
@491  = ~"I apologize", "Thank you"... Xan, you are a prime example of chivalry!~
@492  = ~Oh, please! Do you think I will believe this load of cheap lies?~
@493  = ~Enough of that, Xan. Let us go.~
@494  = ~I remember your words from long ago: "It is good to have a friend." Back then, I was hesitant. Now, I agree wholeheartedly.~
@495  = ~And you are a prime example of teasing, laughing and ridiculing. Strangely, though, I am not inclined to complain.~
@496  = ~Oh dear. (sigh) You do not need to. Come, let us proceed in silence... and may we speak again some time.~
@497  = ~As you wish, my friend. As you wish.~
@498  = ~So, Melissan it is. I shall stay by your side... and once in my life, I hope it will end well.~
@499  = ~Come, my friend.~
@500  = ~So, Yaga-Shura is dead.~ [O#XAN212]
@501  = ~You sound rather - unimpressed, Xan?~
@502  = ~Indeed.~
@503  = ~At last! It was a long chase, wasn't it?~
@504  = ~Believe me, <CHARNAME>, I am sufficiently impressed with your exploit; it is the state of things in this sorry world that leaves me cold.~
@505  = ~I am not quite sure I take your meaning.~
@506  = ~Oh, I quite understand. Death everywhere... it worries me, too.~
@507  = ~"Life is so hollow" all over again, eh?~
@508  = ~Indeed; but now it is over, who would say things have changed?~
@509  = ~We are two of a kind, then.~
@510  = ~Would you disagree?~
@511  = ~Look at that great stinking corpse. Yaga-Shura was a giant, but inside, he was the same as anyone else.~
@512  = ~Every man is giant in his own head. But look where it all ends up. Food for crows.~
@513  = ~I think I sensed a barb there, Xan.~
@514  = ~Do you imply this is the case with me, as well?~
@515  = ~Such is the great circle of life, and it is not for us to change it.~
@516  = ~Not for me, I am sure.~
@517  = ~No; forgive me, that sense had escaped me. I was speaking only of the giant, not of the <PRO_RACE>. And yet... that you should take offense portends something quite sinister.~
@518  = ~What? The end of the world?~
@519  = ~What exactly do you mean?~
@520  = ~Me? Take offense at you? Xan, I have gotten used to your doomsaying long ago.~
@521  = ~Perhaps for some it is a great consolation. But Yaga-Shura did not intend to enter it voluntary, I am sure.~
@522  = ~But forgive me; I did not mean to compare you two.~
@523  = ~So thought your brother. But forgive me; I did not mean to compare you two.~
@524  = ~I mean that it was you who drew the parallel. Not I.~
@525  = ~A refreshing approach, I am sure. I wonder if you ever listen to anybody but yourself? But perhaps I am being unfair... forgive me.~
@526  = ~Again, forgive me. Let us move on... on, onwards; headlong toward the ruinous conclusion of this whole nasty business.~
@527  = ~The same, the same... all the same!~ [O#XAN213]
@528  = ~I beg your pardon?~
@529  = ~Here we go again.~
@530  = ~Uh-huh. "We're all doomed." I know.~
@531  = ~Forgive me for harping on an old theme. I merely chanced to observe that - well, that is a dragon lying dead at your feet. Yet what do a dragon, a drow, a fire giant, and for that matter, a Sembian, and a corrupted elven mage, have in common?~
@532  = ~Everything, it would seem.~
@533  = ~How drearily alike all the villains of this world: all alike in their vapid lust for power. Vice does not have the verisimilitude of virtue. Yet I - I have lived long enough to know that men, and all living things, vastly prefer it.~
@534  = ~Tell me, <CHARNAME>. Why is that?~
@535  = ~A shortage of original minds, perhaps?~
@536  = ~Oh, power is intoxicating. You and I should know, yes?~
@537  = ~I do not care. They are all dead - what is there to talk about?~
@538  = ~This is no joking matter, <CHARNAME>. All these creatures - alike in their greed - alike in their stupidity. Alike in their pride. Alike in - ~
@539  = ~In what?~
@540  = ~Their loneliness?~
@541  = ~Yes, yes, I've noticed your eloquence. Let us continue quietly, if you please.~
@542  = ~In...~
@543  = ~Never mind, <CHARNAME>. Perhaps they and I are not so dissimilar, after all.~
@544  = ~Yes, indeed. Alike in their loneliness. They are all - ~
@545  = ~...~
@546  = ~You are a proper little imp, <CHARNAME>.~
@547  = ~Am I? But you are not so unlike them. Nor am I.~
@548  = ~But you and them have nothing in common. Do we?~
@549  = ~Now who bristles at imagined insults, Xan?~
@550  = ~Heheh, thank you.~
@551  = ~Why? What have I said?~
@552  = ~Don't you see?~
@553  = ~They and I are not so dissimilar, after all.~
@554  = ~Do we?~
@555  = ~So, once again the dust clears. To reveal the same sad spectacle.~ [O#XAN214]
@556  = ~Excuse me, I feel rather...~
@557  = ~Xan, are you well? Speak to me.~
@558  = ~Gods, get a hold on yourself! These aren't the first dead bodies you've seen, before or after you joined my company.~
@559  = ~I know, they did not deserve this fate.~
@560  = ~No, <CHARNAME>, I am not well. Though, I suppose, in comparison to this young lady here - or that young man over there, - I am quite well indeed.~
@561  = ~No, they are not the first. Nor are they the first innocents. But what is this innocence, after all... ?~
@562  = ~You will think me mad, perhaps, or cruel, but - that is hardly the matter.~
@563  = ~It is very easy to say that a man deserved to die. Or that there was no other choice. And perhaps that is true: I can't say otherwise. I am not so full of love for my fellow man that I would protest us all entirely guiltless. It is more probable that we are all guilty...~
@564  = ~But look at this woman. A minute ago, she was as alive as you or I. I do not think she had been any older than you, <CHARNAME>. She might have been laughing, talking to a friend, thinking of her true love - or she might have been plotting revenge, or stewing in guilt over some horrible crime. It doesn't matter if she was good or not. She could have been a vile person, and the thought is no less devastating: now she will not get up again. And there is nothing anyone can do.~
@565  = ~Death is - terrible, isn't it? It makes no difference that it comes to all of us. And it makes no difference if a saint or a criminal dies, and it makes no difference if we see it once, or on a dozen occasions, or a hundred.~
@566  = ~Take my hand, <CHARNAME>, I... I want to feel that it's still warm. This scorching desert feels very cold now.~
@567  = ~<CHARNAME>, may I speak to you in a rather - serious capacity? One might say militarily.~ [O#XAN215]
@568  = ~I would frankly give my advice, but I don't want to prejudice you. Tell me yourself what you think of this Melissan character.~
@569  = ~I think she is a good woman, devoted to justice; a rare thing in this day.~
@570  = ~She seems like a rather dull do-gooder.~
@571  = ~She seems to be person of good will, but there is a something odd in her manner: I confess she puzzles me.~
@572  = ~No one is motivated solely by altruism. She may have a greater stake in this matter than she says.~
@573  = ~The snake lies with every breath, and in between breaths. But it is better to play along for now: she has helped to further our cause thus far.~
@574  = ~In truth? I confess that, if she is not what she seems, I cannot imagine what she could be. Yet nonetheless.~
@575  = ~My thoughts precisely. There is something much amiss with her, and I will endeavor to put my finger on it.~
@576  = ~Think of it, <CHARNAME>, recall her face. We know many people who have devoted their lives to the right... Think of Sir Ryan Trawl; think of the Grand Dukes of Baldur's Gate. Think of the Priests of Ilmater in the slums. Do you know what I mean?~
@577  = ~Virtue is difficult. It takes a tremendous effort to live a life not lost to vice and dissipation - this much I know myself. But to be such a champion of the right as this wench claims to be, surely requires a lifetime of penitential suffering. Her face should be lined, cracked, hardened - even if she smiles, one should be able to see pain. The most cheerful often have the deepest sense of life's cruelties.~
@578  = ~But in that woman's face, there is only a vapid, soft beauty. She looks like any doe-eyed courtesan. It is an odd reason to distrust her, perhaps; but I have lived for some time, and I trust my instincts. And I do not trust her.~
@579  = ~Ah-ha, I knew I wasn't the only one! First chance we get, we shall pump her secrets out of her. Nobody puts one over on us, eh?~
@580  = ~I will keep your council in mind, Xan; but we may have no alternative but to cooperate. She seems to know more of this matter than we do.~
@581  = ~What you say has sense, but you speak from instinct, and my instinct differs from yours. I still believe Melissan to be a person of good will.~
@582  = ~Hmm. Xan doesn't trust our only ally... thinks we will all be doomed. Why does this seem as if it's happened before?~
@583  = ~Hmm, your enthusiasm seems to have outstripped mine. I confess that pumping seems rather a strong word: let us wait and see.~
@584  = ~Yes, she knows more. And so did Irenicus before her, and Sarevok - perhaps I speak too strongly. Nonetheless, to know a great deal about a matter is no proof of virtue. It always seems as if our foes have been one step ahead of us, and perhaps it is time we turned the tables.~
@585  = ~You always were inclined to see the good in others, <CHARNAME>. Perhaps it is fitting that we should have ended at each other's sides.~
@586  = ~You laugh, <CHARNAME>; but this is no laughing matter. More than our lives might be at stake.~
@587  = ~In any case, no one enjoys being played for a fool. We will keep our wits about us, and our hands on our swords: it is the only way we have ever survived.~
@588  = ~Why, Xan, you seem rather more attached to this life than in times past.~
@589  = ~Then perhaps we are not doomed, after all?~
@590  = ~Well, what is the point? We are doomed in any case.~
@591  = ~That is precisely the case, I am afraid. You've been a terrible influence on me.~
@592  = ~Perhaps. Perhaps not. Only time will tell.~
@593  = ~That was an uncanny impression, <CHARNAME>.~
@594  = ~So. Farewell to another one of the Five.~ [O#XAN216]
@595  = ~They lived stupid lives and died stupid deaths. Crowing, strutting, posturing - I wonder if any one of them really enjoyed a moment of their lives.~
@596  = ~<CHARNAME>, there is something I must know.~
@597  = ~Then ask, and I will answer. Why do you hesitate?~
@598  = ~You want to grill me about my destiny, just like everyone else, I assume.~
@599  = ~Xan, half the party is mortally wounded; we do not have time for this.~
@600  = ~Indeed. You knew the time would come.~
@601  = ~Very well, perhaps I will broach the subject another time. It is not an idle one, I assure you.~
@602  = ~Tell me this, <CHARNAME> - I will not ask you what you will do at the end of this business. I merely wish to know - when you look at these creatures, how they lived and died. Sendai's loyal minions. Abazigal's hoard. Does it appeal to you? Do you, for the slightest instant, think that it would be good and pleasant to follow in their footsteps?~
@603  = ~Are you joking? To become such a monster, blood on my hands, in constant fear of my life? No, thank you.~
@604  = ~Are you joking? To follow after these inept cretins? They are dead. No, thank you.~
@605  = ~I will follow them in that I will seek power, but I will use it for the good. I will not come to their fate.~
@606  = ~Xan, I - yes, I cannot lie to you. There are times when I think it would be a glorious thing indeed. But I resist.~
@607  = ~I shall follow, thank you. They had the right idea, but they were weak. I am not.~
@608  = ~This is good to hear, <CHARNAME>.~
@609  = ~Though it does not mean we may not come to a bad end yet. The powers of evil are strong and cunning: I never claimed to be a match for them myself. But they have taken no notice of me, because I'm small: they will concentrate all their might on you.~
@610  = ~Your reply is masked: do you mean to say that you will simply outstrip them in villainy? But each of them thought the same.~
@611  = ~Tread carefully, <CHARNAME> - have we not seen such reasoning before? It is sometimes on the very steps of the temple that a very good man stumbles; and when such a man stumbles, he becomes very evil indeed. An evil merchant is more of a monster than an evil beggar; an evil priest is worse; a fallen solar is the most terrible of all.~
@612  = ~Of course. But - oh, thank the gods, there is such sincerity in your voice. Do not give up: I believe you can win.~
@613  = ~Abazigal, perhaps, was the most powerful of the Five. I believe he could have defeated any of the others in a square duel. Yet even he was overcome by another, still more powerful - you. And who is to say that you will not also be overcome... ?~
@614  = ~I am to say. Someone in the Realms must be the most powerful, at all times, and I intend that it should be me.~
@615  = ~That is a rather feeble argument, Xan. I am to refuse my blood... simply because of fear?~
@616  = ~You have a point, I suppose. But when it comes to that, we'll just have to see, won't we?~
@617  = ~I can only hope this is some false bravado. Beware, <CHARNAME> - or you may soon be greeting Abazigal in the afterlife. And that is no threat: I have no need to make one.~
@618  = ~Fear? No. We have much to be afraid of in any case, but if you follow this path, ruin is certain. Today or tomorrow - or a year hence.~
@619  = ~That is all I have to say.~
@620  = ~(sigh) Yes, I suppose we will.~
@621  = ~But do be careful.~
@622  = ~I am no champion of virtue, you know this. Nevertheless I think I understand the way that it wars with vice. The devil within you urges evil acts and promises good rewards - and some men are so depraved that they commit the acts in any case, and some are deceived by the promise. The Five, I think, were such horrors that they worshipped evil for its own sake; most men worship it because they think it will lead to good. But vice's consolation is empty: its pleasures are hollow. Many seek power, but they end crippled and powerless.~
@623  = ~If you do not desire such things as they claim to offer - which you would not even have, but which could still tempt you - I believe you are halfway toward winning the battle.~
@624  = ~Quite a pretty speech, but quite unnecessary. I do not fear this devil of yours.~
@625  = ~Thank you for your - encouragement, I suppose. With friends around me, I too believe I can win this fight.~
@626  = ~You frighten me, Xan. Couldn't you simply tell everything will be alright?~
@627  = ~Better men and women than you - forgive me, <CHARNAME> - would do well to fear it. But your good will is some comfort. Let us speak of this no more.~
@628  = ~Ah... <CHARNAME>. Dear words. Now if only I could say the same, with as much certainty...~
@629  = ~<CHARNAME>... after all this time, you don't really know me, do you?~
@630  = ~Do not... listen to them. These are the spirits... the former wielders of my blade. I have heard of such apparitions, but it is rare that they... should take such a present hand. But I know they do not speak the truth, and I will not yield.~ [O#XAN217]
@631  = ~It is all right, my love. I understand.~
@632  = ~Are you sure? They seemed so real...~
@633  = ~But, perhaps, this was the truth, and you have strayed from your chosen path?~
@634  = ~I will always be a moon elf. A moonblade wielder. And in the face of all the monstrous indignities and absurdities of this world, I will always bear this blade, and bear it with pride. But my life is my own to live: it does not belong to the dead.~
@635  = ~I know. You have made the right choice.~
@636  = ~Are you sure?~
@637  = ~But what about your duty?~
@638  = ~You will not leave me, then?~
@639  = ~<CHARNAME>, I would say that I have made my choice  but in spite of what these pale ghosts say, I do not believe it is any choice at all. My service to you is my service to my ancestors, to my duty... it is the first time I have regarded anything in this world, save for myself. I have not turned my back on anything: rather, perhaps, I have faced it all for the first time.~
@640  = ~Come. Let us see what your father's hospitable minions prepared for us this time.~
@641  = ~Seldarine... I have... I have never seen anything as... majestic.~ [O#XAN218]
@642  = ~Majestic? I thought you'd say 'terrifying' or the like.~
@643  = ~It is inspiring, I agree.~
@644  = ~Hmmm... it would make a good stronghold of sorts.~
@645  = ~It is a human construction, not elven, but I see its beauty regardless. A perfect shelter, an impenetrable stronghold, an ideal... prison.~
@646  = ~A shelter? Would *you* want to live here?~
@647  = ~A stronghold? Why, I like the idea.~
@648  = ~A prison? I wonder, who is contained within?~
@649  = ~Yes, the place draws the eye, I suppose.~
@650  = ~In times of danger... why not? A threat approaches, <CHARNAME>. A major threat, compared to which, this 'Imprisoned One' is but a trio of stray gibberlings. This threat is you - you and your siblings, who are prophesied to tear this world apart.~
@651  = ~But it is irrelevant now. It will come; let us speak no more of it. In fact, it has come already. As for the Imprisoned One...~
@652  = ~(sigh) You will see a hole in the gutter and claim it your own. What will you do with your multiple possessions?~
@653  = ~Oh, but never mind: I definitely do not want to know.~
@654  = ~One they call the Imprisoned One. I know nothing more of the creature, however.~
@655  = ~Do you intend to proceed? A foolish question, of course: you do. But... is there a slimmest chance that I will make you change your mind and return to the less dangerous tasks?~
@656  = ~I am sorry, Xan, but - no.~
@657  = ~Are you joking? Of course not!~
@658  = ~What would you call less dangerous? Fighting my siblings, perhaps? There is nowhere to hide but here, Xan.~
@659  = ~I just might, actually...~
@660  = ~Why, yes. Persuade me.~
@661  = ~As I thought.~
@662  = ~No, <CHARNAME>. I never joke about saving our lives. You, on the other hand, are doing everything to make our lives a joke.~
@663  = ~There is no other place to hide... besides this. Ironic, isn't it?~
@664  = ~I have nothing to add, it seems.~
@665  = ~Think of leaving, then, before it is too late. You will be able to return here later, I am sure. As for now... let us depart. Please.~
@666  = ~(sigh) When you adopt such a tone, I very well see there is no point.~
@667  = ~We have done that. We are free. I can scarcely believe it.~ [O#XAN139]
@668  = ~Yes, killing the Prince of Demons was not an easy feat.~
@669  = ~Ha! I killed demons by the dozens! This one was no exception.~
@670  = ~Done what? Killed Demogorgon?~
@671  = ~Free? From what?~
@672  = ~Not the Prince of Demons, <CHARNAME>. His avatar. Would the real Demogorgon appear here, he would have smeared us in an instant.~
@673  = ~You were incredibly lucky. Had we lost, our souls would be lying at Demogorgon's mercy. The very idea chills me.~
@674  = ~Ah, the fact that we could have stayed immured in his lair never reached your mind? I thought not.~
@675  = ~We could have remained there. All of us. If not for sheer, incredible luck, the sealed chamber of the Watcher's Keep could have become our grave. For all eternity! Seldarine, why do I travel with you? We are surely doomed.~
@676  = ~Because we are friends?~
@677  = ~Because love means more than death?~
@678  = ~I have no idea.~
@679  = ~Why indeed? Tell me.~
@680  = ~We are... my friend. But still...~
@681  = ~It does. But is it more powerful than death? I would die for you, but wouldn't you rather have me by your side? I have many reasons to stay alive, as I am sure do you.~
@682  = ~Probably because there is something else behind your recklessness and occasional rudeness. Probably because sometimes, I see glimpses of a good and decent person within - admirable, even. Probably...~
@683  = ~Still, all these reasons will be vain if I die. I know that it is useless to ask you, but I will: do not rush to face such an enemy next time.~
@684  = ~You are right. It is useless.~
@685  = ~This was the last time, I promise.~
@686  = ~We are adventurers. Deal with it.~
@687  = ~Sometimes we have to, Xan. There is nothing I can do about it.~
@688  = ~I doubt there is another Imprisoned One somewhere waiting for us, anyway.~
@689  = ~(sigh) As I expected.~
@690  = ~(sigh) Of course, of course. As if the Five and their minions were dead and gone...~
@691  = ~You were not *required* to visit the Watcher's Keep, and you were hardly *forced* to open the seals and pull the levers. You had full choice in the matter.~
@692  = ~(shudder) I should hope not! Alas, your siblings are more than a match.~
@693  = ~Ah, but it is useless to continue this discussion. In a tenday, you will probably stumble upon a dragon's lair, and claim you feel obliged to slay the beast. So predictable...~
@694  = ~Reckless little suicide monger! Do you have any idea of what you have done? It was dangerous beyond all bounds! Why, why do you insist on sticking your nose into every hole?~ [O#XAN138]
@695  = ~Stop shouting, will you? Yes, I like adventure. So what?~
@696  = ~Well, kill the monster, take the treasure - you know how it goes.~
@697  = ~I thought you liked me for who I was.~
@698  = ~If you are scared, you may leave.~
@699  = ~Hey, calm down! It is not like it was the first dragon I killed, anyway.~
@700  = ~Hey, calm down! It is not like it was the first Demilich I killed, anyway.~
@701  = ~(sigh) I know. But you were a within a hairbreadth of death... and I could not do anything. I would kill anyone who would harm a hair on your head, but a demon, a dragon or a lich would be too much even for me.~
@702  = ~There is a bright side, Xan. We are becoming powerful. These battles are preparing me for the harder ones to come.~
@703  = ~Do not torment yourself. You care, and it is enough for me.~
@704  = ~Your concern is touching, but hardly necessary. More, it is annoying.~
@705  = ~Yes, yes. Now, enough dallying here!~
@706  = ~I do. I adore you for who you are. But how will I show it to your lifeless body? Or to a pile of dust you are going to become?~
@707  = ~How, you say? Do you want me to show you, hm?~
@708  = ~I understand your fears, but there is nothing I can do.~
@709  = ~All right. I will wave the adventure goodbye and settle down with you. For a month or two. Then the war will find me there. Is that what you want?~
@710  = ~Abandon you here? No. No. The idea is preposterous.~
@711  = ~Then just take me for what I am.~
@712  = ~What do you propose? I cannot stop taking risks, even for you.~
@713  = ~I will be as careful as possible, but I cannot know what awaits me around the corner.~
@714  = ~Then let's not waste time here! This delay annoys the hell out of me!~
@715  = ~As opposed to what? Killing another demon, dragon or a mad mage? (sigh) Thrilling perspective, no doubt.~
@716  = ~A perfect place for the demonstration, I see. No, <CHARNAME>. Another time, perhaps. There are too many concerns at the moment: this place, your heritage, the Five...~
@717  = ~Or, rather, give you a fine chance to miss all these battles to come, under the pretense of being dead.~
@718  = ~Ah, never mind. It is hopeless.~
@719  = ~Thank you. If only you remembered this, and were more careful...~
@720  = ~Do not start battles such as this, then. This way, you will be free of my 'touching concern' entirely.~
@721  = ~An Archmage, are you. Who would have thought...~ [O#XAN219]
@722  = ~Yes, uncle Quayle was so thrilled... Although it feels strange, doesn't it? And for you, too.~
@723  = ~It does feel queer at times. How can this body, so fragile, encompass enough magical energy to destroy half of the Realms?~
@724  = ~Does it frighten you, too?~
@725  = ~... A little.~
@726  = ~Sometimes I almost feel it bursting - and I'd like to run away, wherever, because I am so afraid... Can I really control it? Can I? Tell me, Xan... am I wrong to be that way?~
@727  = ~Well. They say you cannot run away from yourself. I certainly tried, but to no avail. Perhaps stale trivialities have some point, after all. And no, Aerie, you should not be ashamed of your urges. You are a better soul than me.~
@728  = ~You are brave, too. The number of foes you've vanquished... and that you stayed with us, despite everything...~
@729  = ~Perhaps being true to <CHARNAME>'s cause overweighs everything for you, Aerie, but I assure you, I - ~
@730  = ~I...~
@731  = ~Ah, never mind. Perhaps you are right, and we are braver than the bravest - on the inside. The outside, however, is lacking.~
@732  = ~P-perhaps. But we've grown up a little, haven't we?~
@733  = ~Ah, Aerie... when you smile like that, I don't think you ever will.~
@734  = ~You look thoughtful, Xan. Regrets about your current path, perhaps?~ [O#XAN000]
@735  = ~Not as much as about our inevitable demise, but... ahem. I am sorry, Anomen. Yes, I have regrets. Who doesn't?~ [O#XAN220]
@736  = ~Hmph. I dare say you were lucky <CHARNAME> had forgiven you for your transgressions. You severely challenged <PRO_HISHER> friendship over these past days.~
@737  = ~And yet once again we travel together. Yes, Fate plays strange tricks upon us all.~
@738  = ~To those who forego their duty, it does.~
@739  = ~Yes... (sigh) Now I admit I indeed have regrets. Should I have looked past your appearance of a brash youth, should I have listened to your words long ago and dedicated myself solely to duty, many things could have been different.~
@740  = ~You surprise me, Xan. Who would have thought you have grown wiser.~
@741  = ~Not wiser, no. Severely beaten, perhaps.~
@742  = ~They say that experience is the hardest school...~
@743  = ~... But fools will learn in no other. Indeed it is so. Let us continue, then. I do not doubt I have a lot to learn in this short stretch of time that we are given.~
@744  = ~Great changes are at hand. The balance is challenged yet again.~ [O#XAN000]
@745  = ~(groan) I know, I know... Heavens, don't we deserve some peace?~ [O#XAN221]
@746  = ~Not until the matter at hand is resolved, I fear.~
@747  = ~Yes, how could I forget? Of course. We are all doomed to sleep inside some black monstrosity, eat Seldarine knows what and wear layers upon layers of muck by day and night - all to make sure <CHARNAME> graciously steps on <PRO_HISHER> throne when the time comes. How grand.~
@748  = ~I would not be so rash, Xan. A feather flies where'er the wind wills it to, but a bird has wings. <CHARNAME> is a strong-willed young <PRO_MANWOMAN>. Give <PRO_HIMHER> a chance. Give <PRO_HIMHER> time.~
@749  = ~(sigh) Sometimes I think I would have given <PRO_HIMHER> all the time in the world, just to be able to walk in the grass and bathe in hot springs again. How long has it been since we beheld the forests unmarred by blood, Cernd?~
@750  = ~(sigh) A while. Hopefully, when the time comes to make a choice, we will all get our heart's desires.~
@751  = ~Oh, yes. We all shall.~
@752  = ~And still you are here! When will you understand at last that this group has no need of your services!~ [O#XAN000]
@753  = ~Come again? Where do you suppose I should be?~ [O#XAN222]
@754  = ~Not among our renowned company, this I can vouch for. (A hedge wizard presumes himself my equal, and challenges my position in the group! The indignity! I will have none of it!)~
@755  = ~Hmm? Edwin, are you envious? I certainly hope not: you are unrivaled among all the Realms, let alone Thay, and I am serious when I say it.~
@756  = ~Bah, cheap flattery! Although... you truly think so?~
@757  = ~Why would I lie? I dread to think what your powers will be spent on, that's true. But otherwise, yes, I am entirely truthful.~
@758  = ~Hmm... But how two mages of our caliber can make themselves useful in a group as tiny as this?~
@759  = ~By splitting the targets, I suppose.~
@760  = ~Ah. Very insightful, I see. Now, if you practice some disabling spells for the next battle, I will finish them off quicker... come, let us discuss it and leave these monkeys to their gawking. It is always a pleasure to speak to a man of worth...~
@761  = ~My petrel, you seem drawn today.~ [O#XAN000]
@762  = ~And?~ [O#XAN223]
@763  = ~So rude. 'Twas a mere gesture of courtesy; must you exhibit your lack of manners so often?~
@764  = ~Or, perchance, a secret heartache gnaws at you? Then - my apologies, friend, for this sparrow knows the poignancy of unrequited love and treasures it... although an eager maiden, they say, is worth a dozen pale anchorites.~
@765  = ~I care not what they say. I...~
@766  = ~Ah, there is nothing more beautiful than a heart burning brighter than the moon... only to be found in cooling ashes with the dawn. Treasure this short moment, my petrel, for its beauty lies precisely in its frailty.~
@767  = ~But I prattle on, whereas the answer is still in the air. Are you in love or are you not?~
@768  = ~... (sigh) Yes, Haer'Dalis, I am madly, truly and irrevocably in love. Are you sated at last?~
@769  = ~I admit 'tis surprises me... for I know not the maiden's name. Keep it secret, if you must, but - ~
@770  = ~Oh, but I make no secret of her name, and would gladly introduce you to her, for she is truly an invaluable companion.~
@771  = ~This sparrow awaits most eagerly, I assure you.~
@772  = ~Of course. Her name is Silence.~
@773  = ~Your wit is sharp, my petrel, but not sharp enough to grant a truly inspiring performance. 'Tis passable for an amateur, however.~
@774  = ~As you see fit.~
@775  = ~Young lady! Get over here a moment, I want to talk to you.~ [O#XAN224]
@776  = ~I-I beg your pardon?~
@777  = ~Don't think I didn't see you making eyes at that - revolting mercenary character. What have you got to say for yourself?~
@778  = ~Hey, I thought he was cute! And besides, you aren't my father, Xan.~
@779  = ~He was a monstrous lumbering oaf who would get you with child and leave you to starve by the wayside. And if your father were here... well, erm...~
@780  = ~If my father were here, he'd tell me to kill the lot of you and string you up by your ankles, I'd wager.~
@781  = ~Well, that you haven't got an upstanding father is all the more reason you ought to listen to me. I was your age once, you know; I know what these bucks are after. And another thing...~
@782  = ~(sniff)~
@783  = ~Ye Gods. Is that scent?~
@784  = ~Ew, get away from me! Maybe <CHARNAME> likes it when you stick that beaky nose in <PRO_HISHER> face, but - ~
@785  = ~Come here this minute! You are going to wash that out of your hair if I have to hold you down and scrub myself!~
@786  = ~<CHARNAME>! <CHARNAME>!~
@787  = ~Do you plan to return to Evereska eventually, Xan?~ [O#XAN000]
@788  = ~Oh, yes. Home beckons. And you - you are home now, I take it?~ [O#XAN225]
@789  = ~It would be bold to call it home - but yes, Tethyr and Calimshan are as close to my homeland as I can get. Mine... and Khalid's.~
@790  = ~Your husband came from Calimshan, did he not? His mother was one of these unfortunate elven girls caught and sold into slavery, I remember.~
@791  = ~You would think so, would you? No. It was worse than that.~
@792  = ~Pardon?~
@793  = ~She went adventuring voluntary. The stupid girl wanted freedom, and modest charms of the open road beckoned her, as I imagine. Well - you know how that had ended.~
@794  = ~Indeed. A little more than a harem slave... with a son daily abused in front of her, at that. No wonder she did not survive to see him grow... I do not envy her.~
@795  = ~Keep watch over the young girls in your city then, when you return. Who knows how many lives will not be laid to waste.~
@796  = ~True, Jaheira. I will.~
@797  = ~... So of course I said to them, That's no drow raider, that's my friend...~ [O#XAN226]
@798  = ~You know, Xanny-boy, I couldn't but overhear, and - ~
@799  = ~No.~
@800  = ~Stop.~
@801  = ~I am sorry, you know, but you really will have to make yourself a touch more articulate. I don't know how it is with you elves, but we lower races do have a tendency to use words containing more than one syllable to make ourselves understood, and - ~
@802  = ~What I was just saying to <CHARNAME> reminded you of some interminable, meandering story from your family history which, in its desperate convolution, resembles the most intrigue-ridden Royal clan in the Realms? And now you are going to tell me this story, in spite of my frequent and unsubtle entreaties, and - ~
@803  = ~Why - the thought never crossed my mind, Xanny-boy.~
@804  = ~W-what?~
@805  = ~I only wanted to say how brave you were, sticking up for your friend like that; and that it's precisely that upstanding nature which makes you such a worthy companion. Why, I might have been given up the ghost on a dozen occasions if not your timely, if slightly grumbling, intervention.~
@806  = ~Honestly! We're beating off fire giants and hordes of Bhaalspawn with a giant proverbial stick, and you imagine I'd waste yours and <CHARNAME>'s time spinning old family tales? I am surprised at you, Xanny-boy.~
@807  = ~Anyway, when you are through gawking in that most unbecoming manner, I'll be over there preparing our supper. Our noble leader does need <PRO_HISHER> strength, after all.~
@808  = ~This, ah, supper... will it have... turnips in it?~
@809  = ~Not as such. While I am partial to that vegetable you name, where would we find turnips here? It's fish.~
@810  = ~... I am dreaming, am I?~
@811  = ~Tell me, good brother paladin - and believe me, we have been comrades these many a day, and I mean you no offense. I know my tongue is sharp.~ [O#XAN227]
@812  = ~Ha! Speak on, man, and I will hear you with affection.~
@813  = ~Then tell me this. Do you ever think on your own death? I see the gray hairs about your head, and I know that for a man, the end of life draws nigh.~
@814  = ~Well bespoken. Few men deem it delicate to ask, but I am with you: I think we do well to speak of it. For a warrior, as the Kara-Turans say, death walks always behind or to one side. And we are warriors, you and I, however our arts may differ.~
@815  = ~I think on my own death often - and those of others. The ones I love. The ones that I, in my imperfection, hate.~
@816  = ~And as time wears on, does the thought trouble you less? Or more?~
@817  = ~More. More.~
@818  = ~That is not what I expected.~
@819  = ~I know it. I was raised, in the Church, to believe that we are immortal beings  and that the end of this life is the beginning of another life, still grander; to each according to his deserts.~
@820  = ~I have believed this since I was a youth, and I believe it still: do not think it is the creeping worm of Doubt that troubles me, in these waning years. I believe it, perhaps, more deeply than I ever have.~
@821  = ~And oft times I pause, and think - shall I truly see the face of Torm? Shall I behold his face with these two eyes, and shall he say to me - well, rendered Goodman? And shall I truly pass to my reward?~
@822  = ~I am sure, as I have ever been sure of the sky, or trees, or of love, that these things will be. Yet I cannot even begin to imagine it. Such goodness, such good fortune, is almost - terrifying.~
@823  = ~And I am afraid.~
@824  = ~... I see.~
@825  = ~And what of you, my friend? Or do you prefer to keep these things within? I can well see that you might.~
@826  = ~Sometimes I think it would be kinder if we ceased to be.~
@827  = ~Surely, after all this time - we deserve so much?~
@828  = ~Verily, I believe I know your meaning.~
@829  = ~But someday - soon, I suppose, and very soon - we shall see.~
@830  = ~Shan't we?~
@831  = ~Yes. I suppose we shall.~
@832  = ~Aye, aye, good loot an' all. Mayhap I won't need to gut ye all soon, eh?~ [O#XAN000]
@833  = ~Mayhap, mayhap. Say, Korgan, are you interested in anything besides gold and blood?~ [O#XAN228]
@834  = ~I am no whinin' prissy, elf. If I be dead, I be dead, but this gold to my grave I be takin'!~
@835  = ~To the Nether Realms? To the Blood War, maybe? Of what use will it be to you then, poor soul?~
@836  = ~Gold is gold is gold, ye ninny!~
@837  = ~And death is death is death.~
@838  = ~And me axe is me axe! Now shut yer gap, wizard. Guttin' ye alone will be a pleasure.~
@839  = ~Do you think of the future often, Mazzy?~ [O#XAN229]
@840  = ~Sometimes, when the fire is low and the next morning is far away. Do you?~
@841  = ~Too often, I'm afraid. What do you see?~
@842  = ~I... I am not used to this sort of conversation, Xan. I keep my eyes on the day ahead. To do otherwise is death. But sometimes... sometimes...~
@843  = ~You see home, do you? And family.~
@844  = ~(sigh) Much like me.~
@845  = ~What would you need a family for, Xan? Death is and has always been your sole fascination.~
@846  = ~But I am still alive, and so are you. Perhaps our futures, so different from what we do now, are meant to be? Perhaps all our lives, we believed in things that would bring us pride, but no pleasure?~
@847  = ~Pleasure is idle. We were born for greater deeds.~
@848  = ~Yes... yes. But haven't we done enough? Bards exchange tales of a stalwart halfling maiden already... and a fanciful story or two about me, no doubt. The road calls, Mazzy - but it is a road that leads home.~
@849  = ~I know, but it lies many years away.~
@850  = ~Is it? You have only one life. There is no shame to walk the road you choose to walk in your heart - in fact, it is great courage.~
@851  = ~Tell me true, Xan: are you trying to convince me or yourself?~
@852  = ~Minsc! Tell me, comrade - how does it feel to be the hero of a great saga?~ [O#XAN230]
@853  = ~Ah, it reminds me of the time when sweet Dynaheir was alive. We traveled the Sword Coast, and every night, she repeated we would become great and mighty heroes.~
@854  = ~And so you did. But why was Dynaheir so sure? If you know, of course... she was quite secretive, was she not?~
@855  = ~Oh, pretty Dynaheir knew the old prophecy about the great war in the South! She told me we would travel with the Chosen Prawn... sawn... Spawn, and bring <PRO_HIMHER> to the Light, and trump the Wicked with our Boots of Righteousness!~
@856  = ~So even then she knew something special about our esteemed leader, did she? I wonder if she foresaw her own death, as well.~
@857  = ~I... Dynaheir...~
@858  = ~Dynaheir, forgive me! I failed... failed... DYNAHEIR!~
@859  = ~Oh, no... I am sorry, Minsc. I am sorry for reminding you. But she fulfilled her mission, did she not? She brought us together at <CHARNAME>'s side. Although gods know how this may end...~
@860  = ~Yes! We will fight for goodness in Dynaheir's name, and she will smile at us from... from...~
@861  = ~From above. Come, Minsc. And - I am sorry. Being a hero is not all about sun and roses, eh?~
@862  = ~Are there any more peaks for you and I to climb, I wonder?~ [O#XAN231]
@863  = ~We are both Archmages. We know the basics inside out, feel the energies wrestle with our minds daily; nearly all spells are laid bare before our eyes - there is no incantation we wouldn't master.~
@864  = ~What next?~
@865  = ~Perfection?~
@866  = ~I suppose... but isn't there a goal? Can you really believe that this force, this power, will serve only decay and death, and in a few decades, will abandon its wielder? There must be a point.~
@867  = ~But of course there is one. Do good, Xan. This is what we all are here for.~
@868  = ~Mmm. I cannot say I am entirely convinced that following <CHARNAME> for the moment will bring *anyone* any good, <CHARNAME> included. And when it is over - do you truly think that what is good for one is good for another?~
@869  = ~Don't hide behind sophistics, Xan. There is Good, and you know it.~
@870  = ~And you think Good cannot exist unsupported by fire balls and lightning bolts? Do you truly believe magic means as little as that?~
@871  = ~This is not for me to answer, Xan. I have made my choices already. This is up to you.~
@872  = ~Something tells me that whatever choices I make, sooner or later I will regret them.~
@873  = ~Well, you were the one to complain there was nothing left for us to do.~
@874  = ~Elf! You seem to know much of the nature of evil men, for one who always lacked the stomach to become one.~ [O#XAN000]
@875  = ~I will book no insults from this butcher. <CHARNAME>, are you certain it was a wise idea - ~ [O#XAN232]
@876  = ~No, not to be truly evil; nor yet truly good. In Sembia they call it servus - 'the gray lands.' That is where you dwell, elf, and you call that virtue.~
@877  = ~And you think you are better than I?~
@878  = ~I have looked the dark gods in the face. I doubt you could say the same.~
@879  = ~Oh, really? I daresay I am looking a dark god in the face right now.~
@880  = ~A moment of your time. I have a question for you, mage.~ [O#XAN000]
@881  = ~I am positively quivering with anticipation. See these hands, Sarevok? Quivering.~ [O#XAN233]
@882  = ~Do not play the fool. Simply put, do you trust me? Do you believe that my fear of <CHARNAME>, or some primitive notion of honor I might hold, will overpower my lust for vengeance? Or do you sleep with a dagger under your pillow, waiting to hear my mailed footsteps in the night?~
@883  = ~I cannot imagine you would care a fig for my answer. Since when did you ever?~
@884  = ~I ask out of simple calculation. I do not care a damn if I am liked or not; treated well or badly. I certainly have no love for any of you. But against such odds as this group faces, if we do not stand together - united by at least a mercenary's thimbleful of comradely feeling - we may fall; and all my plans will have been for naught.~
@885  = ~Well put. And to the point: yes, Sarevok. I do trust you. Quite a bit more than I trust many.~
@886  = ~Indeed? But I suspect you toy with me. Tell me the reason. You know how many throats I've cut; how many troughs I could have filled with blood. Why should you trust me, when you have seen what I am capable of?~
@887  = ~If you insist. It is precisely because I have seen what you are capable of.~
@888  = ~I've seen your worst, Sarevok. I've seen all the darker parts of your self run riot. And the same is not true - of <CHARNAME>, for one. Perhaps I fear <PRO_HIMHER> more than you - because I do not know what <PRO_HESHE> might become. Yet I know all too well what you might become, and have... and when it comes to that, well, we've beaten you before.~
@889  = ~It rather reminds me of... in Elven lore, you know, Corellon founded the nation. And he fought many battles with many dark spirits, and one - apocryphal sources suggest it may have been a prince of the Rakshasa - tried to tempt him to evil deeds, and he answered: "Get behind me, fiend!" But you know, I never understood that.~
@890  = ~Why would I want a fiend behind me? I want him precisely where I can see him.~
@891  = ~Ah, so. The wit is matched for this round.~
@892  = ~But nonetheless, sleep lightly, elf. One never knows... Hah. Hah.~
@893  = ~You look strange, Xan. Are you well?~ [O#XAN000]
@894  = ~Mmm? Oh, well enough... don't you worry. It is a laughable matter, really...~ [O#XAN234]
@895  = ~I wouldn't have asked, but you were looking around with such regret in your eyes... so familiar...~
@896  = ~Yes, we all look in the mirror from time to time, do we not? And sometimes we see ourselves in the faces of others. What do you regret, Valygar?~
@897  = ~Regret?~
@898  = ~Our adventures together draw to a close. Soon we are all to go our separate ways... in solitude.~
@899  = ~I am used to be on my own. It is not a burden.~
@900  = ~A few months ago, it was not, I agree. But now - now both of us have friends, do we not? We have changed, Valygar. We let others into our hearts. Now solitude is no longer welcome. In fact, I often think of it as - loneliness.~
@901  = ~It will be the same for me. My cabin, my peace - ~
@902  = ~ - my regrets - ~
@903  = ~Perhaps. But it can be no other way. Our mission will end, and so be it. Less foul magic around... and no more fear that one day, my friends may share my parents' fate. Let us finish it here.~
@904  = ~Viconia, I'd like to ask for your... forgiveness.~ [O#XAN235]
@905  = ~Forgiveness? Are you out of your mind, perchance?~
@906  = ~I might well be, yes. But regardless...~
@907  = ~I have been watching you for a while - with suspicion, of course - but only now I have noticed that all the while, you never intended to betray us. You have been loyal from the start, to <CHARNAME> especially. You never refused to heal our wounds - you followed us everywhere - you were not afraid of your drow brethren, even.~
@908  = ~Wasn't it obvious from the very start? My, but you are dumber than a drider.~
@909  = ~Ah, yes. Of course. Then you would open your mouth, say a word or two, and I would not understand how I could feel any pity towards you: I'd be filled with seething hatred.~
@910  = ~(snort) Is your mewling going anywhere?~
@911  = ~Exactly. Words are nothing. You were - and still are - frightened and insecure, Viconia, and so you hid yourself behind a wall of bitter bile.~
@912  = ~You dare?!~
@913  = ~Am I wrong?~
@914  = ~Do you want to meet a slow and painful death right now, male? Your pathetic sniveling is getting on my nerves.~
@915  = ~(sigh) Viconia, behind all this - insults, gestures, looks and Seldarine knows what else - I see a loyal companion who saved my life more than a few times, and towards whom I have never shown as much as a flicker of gratitude. I want to apologize for that. Is this so hard to understand?~
@916  = ~What do you expect, now? Do you expect Viconia will take you as her confidante, hmm?~
@917  = ~No. I expect to rest with clear conscience tonight.~
@918  = ~Selfish fool. You just used the occasion to look good and noble in the eyes of others. Ah, so familiar... Get out of my sight with your apologies. They are worth less than dirt underneath my feet.~
@919  = ~<CHARNAME>, you are a remarkable woman indeed.~ [O#XAN000]
@920  = ~That so, Valygar? Why?~
@921  = ~We daughters of Bhaal tend to be this way.~
@922  = ~Thank you for the compliment, ranger.~
@923  = ~I did not mean to come across as flippant, my lady... <CHARNAME>. But I look at you and see someone suffering from a great loss.~
@924  = ~I see a woman of great strength and virtue, who does not deserve one tenth of the suffering she went through.~
@925  = ~If it were in my power to bring dead back, I would hesitate. This is unnatural, and brings all kinds of grief to all. But when I look at you, I almost wish I had this power.~
@926  = ~Thank you, Valygar.~
@927  = ~Are you sure you are not in love with me?~
@928  = ~This is impossible. You cannot return a man from Arvandor.~
@929  = ~I am fine. Why do you think I am not?~
@930  = ~I should not say this, I know... but Xan was the luckiest man on Faerun. And... a man would pay for such happiness with his life gladly.~
@931  = ~I am sorry. I will leave you alone... just know that you have a friend.~
@932  = ~I worry for you, <CHARNAME>. I sense that your soul grows weary.~ [O#XAN000]
@933  = ~Our recent battles were exhausting indeed.~
@934  = ~Well, you know why this is, don't you?~
@935  = ~How are you, Keldorn? Are you well?~
@936  = ~I was thinking of my family, my children... and praying to Torm I would come home and find them in good health.~
@937  = ~After Xan's death, I realized what a fool I was. Maria needed me, and I had too little time to give her... and soon, the day will come when there will be none at all. Should I return, things will be different.~
@938  = ~The seriousness of our situation is great enough, so I will say no more. What will come will come. But, gods willing, I would like nothing more than to return to my daughters safely, and to see you happy again.~
@939  = ~How can this be possible, Keldorn?~
@940  = ~What are you talking about?~
@941  = ~I wish you well, but I can never reach Arvandor, and Xan can never return.~
@942  = ~Have faith, <CHARNAME>. Xan's sacrifice was worth his passing. The entire city is saved, and your soul is yours again. Gods willing, you will find peace.~
@943  = ~Thank you, Keldorn.~
@944  = ~I don't want peace, Keldorn. I want him.~
@945  = ~Should I die, we will end up on different planes... if I end up anywhere at all.~
@946  = ~The very gods damned you, 'tis true. I will pray for you, my friend.~
@947  = ~Torm's blessing upon you, my friend.~
@948  = ~You are pale, <CHARNAME>. Do you sleep well?~ [O#XAN000]
@949  = ~Yes... no. I see Xan in my dreams.~
@950  = ~I dreamt of Xan last night.~
@951  = ~Well enough, Jaheira, do not worry.~
@952  = ~I heard you talking in the night. Was it a dream? Another nightmare of... Irenicus?~
@953  = ~Not Irenicus, no. It was Xan.~
@954  = ~I saw Xan in Arvandor.~
@955  = ~Me and Xan were together. I was happy again...~
@956  = ~Stop spying on me!~
@957  = ~I doubt pushing me away will help you in the slightest. But as you wish.~
@958  = ~Ah, I thought you would have. Khalid... comes to me still.~
@959  = ~It is not like that, Jaheira. It is real: I talk and he answers me.~
@960  = ~Do you talk? We do.~
@961  = ~What is the meaning of these dreams? Do you know?~
@962  = ~I do not. Perhaps your grief seeks a release? Your memories gain a dear form? But you say it is more than that.~
@963  = ~Khalid never talked to me. He smiled at me, once, but mostly I saw a grey, bleak shape. If it is different with you, I do not know what to think.~
@964  = ~Perhaps it is a warning? Or a sign of things to come? Be very careful, <CHARNAME>. Gorion and Khalid are gone; I wouldn't want to lose another friend.~
@965  = ~I will be careful. But I want to see Xan again.~
@966  = ~All right. Thank you, Jaheira.~
@967  = ~And how are you? Khalid's loss is still fresh, isn't it?~
@968  = ~Come, now. Let's get moving and talk of this later... if at all.~
@969  = ~It is natural. But I wish your scars would heal faster. You've still a life to live.~
@970  = ~Khalid... died where he should have lived. But he would understand my need to move on. I have obligations, and cannot dwell on my loss.~
@971  = ~Hey, little sister!~ [O#XAN000]
@972  = ~Hmph.~
@973  = ~Actually, *you* are my little sister.~
@974  = ~Hey, Imoen.~
@975  = ~Aw, don't be a bore! We both are, alright? And today it's my turn to be the big one!~
@976  = ~I... saw you thrashing in the night. Real hard. Are you... well, all right? It's about Xan, isn't it?~
@977  = ~Yes, I am all right, and no, it is not about Xan. Subject closed.~
@978  = ~I lie perfectly still and ladylike, thank you.~
@979  = ~We were together in my dream, Xan and I. So sweet...~
@980  = ~It is.~
@981  = ~Come on, <CHARNAME>, you know it isn't true! Tell me.~
@982  = ~All right, all right. I dreamt of Xan and me. Satisfied?~
@983  = ~Yes, I saw Xan in a dream. He talked to me.~
@984  = ~Imoen, just leave me alone.~
@985  = ~Read my lips: "No."~
@986  = ~Oh. He... and you... ?~
@987  = ~I remember, you looked so good together. From the Nashkel mines, remember that? And he used to make you flower wreaths... and cooled water for you by magic... and then, finally, you two disappeared into the forest and went out looking very smug afterwards... Heheh.~
@988  = ~It's a real pity he died. I am so, so sorry for you two. At least, you can see him in your dreams, eh? This is something.~
@989  = ~I wish we all were in Candlekeep again. Things had been so much simpler then.~
@990  = ~I still hope I will be with him again, somehow.~
@991  = ~Yes, ironically, these dreams are all I have.~
@992  = ~I remember, too.~
@993  = ~You weren't with us in Nashkel, Imoen.~
@994  = ~All right, I'll try... not to be a bother. Well... I'll talk to you later, I guess.~
@995  = ~Yeah... it's hard, isn't it? I am sorry it ended like this, <CHARNAME>, I really am. You two deserved much more.~
@996  = ~No, but I heard things. Anyway, I am sorry it ended like this, <CHARNAME>, I really am. You two deserved much more.~
@997  = ~So, sister. I do not see the elven mage with you.~ [O#XAN000]
@998  = ~He died, as did your Tamoko.~
@999  = ~What is he to you? Mind your own business.~
@1000 = ~Xan is dead.~
@1001 = ~Why do you care?~
@1002 = ~Are you afraid to speak of him to me?~
@1003 = ~No, I am not. He is dead.~
@1004 = ~I simply do not want to.~
@1005 = ~Sarevok, Xan is dead. What is there to talk about?~
@1006 = ~Perhaps you will take another consort, then, in time. I find it... interesting.~
@1007 = ~Tamoko... Yes, you killed her, sister, didn't you?~
@1008 = ~You killed her first.~
@1009 = ~I had no choice, Sarevok, and you know it.~
@1010 = ~Yes, I did.~
@1011 = ~I see.~
@1012 = ~And you are still alone, are you? Or... ?~
@1013 = ~Why the interrogation, Sarevok? What exactly do you wish to know?~
@1014 = ~I am still alone.~
@1015 = ~Yes, there is another.~
@1016 = ~Yes, from time to time I have other lovers.~
@1017 = ~And what is it that you do not wish to reveal?~
@1018 = ~It is puzzling that a woman such as yourself denies herself this side of life.~
@1019 = ~Yes, Cythandria was a good distraction. I remember.~
@1020 = ~I lost Tamoko just before my downfall. Soon, you may find yourself in my place.~
@1021 = ~No. Xan loved me, and sacrificed himself for me.~
@1022 = ~It is different. Tamoko ran away from Bhaal in you; Xan supported me in my fight against the Slayer.~
@1023 = ~You sent Tamoko to die. I... didn't... send... Xan...~
@1024 = ~No, brother. I am smarter than you.~
@1025 = ~Perhaps. We shall see.~
@1026 = ~Yes... now you understand, sister. Perhaps you will avoid my mistakes, yet.~
@1027 = ~Xan, you cannot make things right this easily. We need to talk, first.~
@1028 = ~We will. I wanted to speak my mind to you, and I did - but it would have been selfish and presumptuous of me not to give you a chance.~
@1029 = ~I only ask that you wish the same as I - to be able to talk to you once again, to hold your hand, to aid you and to listen to you, as the one who loves you should.~
@1030 = ~Will you... give me a chance in this? I promise, you will be able to tell me everything there is on your mind, and more. But now I am frightened, and overwhelmed - much as you, I suspect - for my heart hangs on the balance. Please... answer me.~
@1031 = ~Yes. You will have your chance... if I am to have mine.~
@1032 = ~I believe you. But do not take me for granted, yet.~
@1033 = ~I love you. What other answer could I give?~
@1034 = ~I am sorry, Xan. It is too late.~
@1035 = ~You are, certainly. Seldarine... is this truly happening?~
@1036 = ~How could I? It is amazing you are still willing to talk with me, to be honest.~
@1037 = ~Melamin... It is a miracle.~
@1038 = ~I... I have never felt happier. Perhaps it is selfish and unfair, considering all that has transpired, no? (sigh) But I cannot help it.~
@1039 = ~Thank the Seldarine for today... and thank you.~
@1040 = ~(A low moan awakens you.)~ [O#XAN000]
@1041 = ~(All seems quiet, but then a twitch from the next bedroll attracts your attention. It seems that Xan is having a nightmare again.)~
@1042 = ~Xan? Xan, wake up!~
@1043 = ~(Shake him awake.)~
@1044 = ~(Go back to rest.)~
@1045 = ~What? <CHARNAME>, what is it?~
@1046 = ~Actually, I should be asking you this.~
@1047 = ~I am fine. What's wrong with you?~
@1048 = ~You were having a nightmare.~
@1049 = ~Try to keep quiet as you sleep, will you?~
@1050 = ~(You lie back down and slowly, all becomes quiet. In the morning, Xan looks exactly the same as he always does.)~
@1051 = ~Ah... Did I wake you up?~
@1052 = ~Don't worry about it. Will you be all right now?~
@1053 = ~Xan, what did you see?~
@1054 = ~Yes, you did! Peruse your nightmares quietly from now on, please.~
@1055 = ~I hope so, but... Will you sit with me for a short while? I am not sure I will rest again - not now, at least.~
@1056 = ~Certainly. What is it?~
@1057 = ~Must have been quite some nightmare.~
@1058 = ~I am sorry, but it is time to go.~
@1059 = ~Oh, but you should know by now, should you not?~
@1060 = ~I saw your death again. This time, however, it was different.~
@1061 = ~Normally - if such an activity could indeed be called normal - you dissolve into dust before my eyes. The backgrounds change, and so do the enemies. Your companions change, even. Sometimes it is another man holding you... sometimes I lie dying at your feet. It matters not: the ending is the same. A cloud of sparkling, weightless dust.~
@1062 = ~This time, you were standing on a pale green platform - it would have reminded me of Suldanessellar, if not for its plainly evil purpose. Evil was practically emanating from its every plate, every stone. We were all assembled by your side, and, of course, the Solar was in front of us. This blue lady and her shiny sword are my constant companions these nights...~
@1063 = ~But I digress. You were alive - you were victorious. You looked at us all... conversed with us... kissed me... and turned away, making your way to the center of the platform. You took one step... two... ten... and then you fell, soundlessly.~
@1064 = ~I darted to your body, already expecting it to start dissolving under my fingers, but it did not. You were dead, though - of that there was no doubt. Your eyes were unseeing, your hands cold, your body limp, and so heavy...~
@1065 = ~I am sorry. You were dead - and yet, some part of me knew that you were not. That you were more than alive - that you were immortal.~
@1066 = ~But there, with me, you were dead.~
@1067 = ~Just another nightmare. Relax, dear: we'll be fine.~
@1068 = ~Did I take over the Throne of Bhaal, then?~
@1069 = ~Yuck. I'd have thought the Solar would destroy the body.~
@1070 = ~Colorful, as always. But if I did not dissolve, my spirit had gone to the Blessed Realm.~
@1071 = ~(sigh) A hard task, this is, but I shall try. Good night, <CHARNAME>... or is it time to go already?~
@1072 = ~It is. Come.~
@1073 = ~You can have more rest, if you want to.~
@1074 = ~Will you tell me what it was all about?~
@1075 = ~I am ready.~
@1076 = ~Truly? Thank you. Melamin, I am so tired...~
@1077 = ~You do not understand, do you? <CHARNAME>, I no longer dread your death as much as I used to: you are way too powerful. But your ascension haunts my dreams unceasingly.~
@1078 = ~(sigh) I do not know how I will survive it, if it comes to be. To know that your hand will never again touch mine after a certain day is excruciating enough. But to witness it all...~
@1079 = ~Xan, who told you I will even have an opportunity to grab Bhaal's power?~
@1080 = ~So, you *are* afraid, aren't you? And I never suspected you were...~
@1081 = ~You will survive. Or I could send you elsewhere.~
@1082 = ~Xan, pay attention to my lips: I - shall - stay - with - you. Clear enough?~
@1083 = ~I love you. And I will continue to, by your side. Trust me.~
@1084 = ~First, it was my inflamed imagination. Then I carefully re-read Alaundo's scrolls, and they added to it. Then, at Suldanessellar, I visited Corellon's temple, and was shocked with the amount of whispers which predicted the same. And, finally, your siblings completed the picture.~
@1085 = ~I am. Every night, and often during the day. The thought simply does not let go.~
@1086 = ~Trust me, <CHARNAME>, it would not matter. With you I at least have some measure of hope... oh, who am I trying to fool? I am unable to leave your side, melamin, and that is that.~
@1087 = ~I wish it was.~
@1088 = ~Repeat it some time. Please. It... helps.~
@1089 = ~Am I doomed to lose you? I look at you in battle, and I am almost certain of it. I look at you now, and it seems a ridiculous thought. But then I close my eyes... (groan) I cannot stand it any more. I just cannot.~
@1090 = ~It is even worse for me, Xan.~
@1091 = ~I know it is hard, but I am here for you.~
@1092 = ~Please, do not make it worse for me.~
@1093 = ~We'll get through it all. Together.~
@1094 = ~(sigh) Yes, of course. Did I tell you how much your strength of heart amazes me?~
@1095 = ~I know. Thank you.~
@1096 = ~Normally I would not... whine... like that, but this night was too much even for me, I suppose. I apologize: from now on, I will support you the best I can. Come.~
@1097 = ~But I know that you'll make the best decision. You always have in the past, and I trust that you always will in the future. You laugh at me for such confidence, but I believe it. You are unique beyond anyone I have ever encountered.~
@1098 = ~I only hope that the life you choose isn't one you regret. As for me... our time together has been worth everything.~
@1099 = ~I am sorry for speaking out of turn before. It is difficult to travel with someone you care about and to remain silent.~ [O#XAN000]
@1100 = ~Someone you care about?~
@1101 = ~I do not mind. Talking to a trusted friend helps.~
@1102 = ~Of course, Valygar. I understand.~
@1103 = ~Try not to attempt it in the future.~
@1104 = ~We all care about you, <CHARNAME>. You carry enough on your shoulders as is.~
@1105 = ~I understand, but do not bring the subject up again.~
@1106 = ~It is good to know. Thank you, Valygar.~
@1107 = ~And I appreciate your help.~
@1108 = ~It means a lot to hear you say that. Thank you.~
@1109 = ~I will not. I am sorry.~
@1110 = ~<CHARNAME>? Do you have a minute?~ [O#XAN000]
@1111 = ~Of course, what is it?~
@1112 = ~I do. Speak up.~
@1113 = ~Can it not wait?~
@1114 = ~Never mind.~
@1115 = ~I couldn't sleep last night... and then I noticed you thrashing, as well. Did you have a bad dream?~
@1116 = ~You come dangerously close to prying.~
@1117 = ~Yes... a bad dream.~
@1118 = ~I do not see how this can be any of your business.~
@1119 = ~Do you really want to know?~
@1120 = ~I am sorry, I shouldn't have asked. If you wish me to go, I will.~
@1121 = ~No, please, don't go. I will tell you, if you wish.~
@1122 = ~Yes, I would prefer if you left me alone.~
@1123 = ~It is not a secret. I saw Xan in my dreams.~
@1124 = ~I wish I could help.~
@1125 = ~I only wish to help. Does it cause you much distress?~
@1126 = ~Well... yes and no. I dream of Xan, you see.~
@1127 = ~In my dream, I was talking to Xan, just as now I am talking to you.~
@1128 = ~I dream of the past... and of those lost.~
@1129 = ~I see.~
@1130 = ~You were very close, <CHARNAME>. It is not surprising that you think of him. It is hard to lose family... lovers... friends. I know this very well.~
@1131 = ~You were never bonded to someone. A part of my heart had been lost.~
@1132 = ~I know about your losses, and I am sorry.~
@1133 = ~We all lost someone, didn't we?~
@1134 = ~I am sorry, too. I wish it got better with time, but it doesn't.~
@1135 = ~I have little consolation to offer, but I hope the pain will become easier for you to bear.~
@1136 = ~I do not think it will, but thank you, regardless.~
@1137 = ~The dreams soothe, not sting. It is the reality that hurts.~
@1138 = ~I hope so.~
@1139 = ~I know it is hard, but I am here for you.~
@1140 = ~Do you worship a god, <CHARNAME>?~ [O#XAN000]
@1141 = ~I am an elf, Valygar. The Seldarine beckon me.~
@1142 = ~Yes, I do.~
@1143 = ~Of course I do, given my training, and you know that.~
@1144 = ~What is the point?~
@1145 = ~I thought as much.~
@1146 = ~Familiar words, and I agree with you.~
@1147 = ~I will not see the light again, after my eyes close. I wonder if submitting to a deity is worth it, sometimes, but I know it doesn't.~
@1148 = ~But you are a Bhaal's child. What happens to you?~
@1149 = ~Nothing. The Bhaal's essence will return to the source.~
@1150 = ~Sarevok turned into dust upon dying in Baldur's Gate. His soul was simply gone.~
@1151 = ~I do not know, Valygar.~
@1152 = ~Yet Sarevok ended up in your pocket dimension, somehow. Nay, it is more complicated than that.~
@1153 = ~They say all elves depart somewhere, when they pass away, beyond any mortal's reach. 'Tis a fitting fate, but you - you are already beyond anyone's reach. I worry for you. You talk little, and laugh even less. Soon, you may become a walking ghost.~
@1154 = ~I would rather worry about your own fate. Valygar, you are making a mistake.~
@1155 = ~I have nothing to laugh about.~
@1156 = ~If I could become a ghost to join Xan, I would.~
@1157 = ~I am trying not to become one, but it is hard.~
@1158 = ~Do not think of me. Think of you.~
@1159 = ~I know.~
@1160 = ~You are a reckless girl - nay, a beautiful and compassionate woman. I hate to see you waste away, for your own sake.~
@1161 = ~For my sake, Valygar, or for yours?~
@1162 = ~I appreciate your words, my friend.~
@1163 = ~I do not see another choice.~
@1164 = ~I think about you more often than I care to admit. But it is not my place to say more.~
@1165 = ~Then I hope that in time, you will see one... or that your elven gods will guide you to your lost lover, before it is too late.~
@1166 = ~I should have said something before, but I will now. <CHARNAME>, will you come aside with me?~ [O#XAN000]
@1167 = ~Oh dear. What for?~
@1168 = ~Valygar, you are not going to confess, are you?~
@1169 = ~Of course. Lead the way.~
@1170 = ~I would rather not, and I feel uncomfortable.~
@1171 = ~Shhh... follow me. I will explain everything.~
@1172 = ~Thank you, my friend.~
@1173 = ~I know. But, please, follow me this one time. I will explain everything.~
@1174 = ~Very well.~
@1175 = ~No. I am sorry.~
@1176 = ~Here.~
@1177 = ~First, you have guessed correctly, <CHARNAME>. For a while now, I have watched you from afar, both with care and concern.~
@1178 = ~Yet, hear me. I am not tactless enough, nor blind enough, to ask anything of you. But there is one thing I feel I must tell you.~
@1179 = ~I grew up in a loveless home, and knew little of affection and care. Now I look at you, and I see the reflection of a boy I once was.~
@1180 = ~I might be mistaken. But know that whenever you need me, I will be there, until you will find it in you to be happy again.~
@1181 = ~Happy? Are you laughing at me, Valygar?~
@1182 = ~You are mistaken. Xan's death was a hard blow, and I miss him, but I am strong enough not to despair.~
@1183 = ~I am relieved. I feared you were in love with me... wait. You are.~
@1184 = ~Thank you, Valygar. I will try to be there for you, too.~
@1185 = ~But I need more than that. I want you as a man, here, with me.~
@1186 = ~Nay, lady. How can I?~
@1187 = ~I know you are a strong woman, but it strikes me sometimes how vulnerable you are.~
@1188 = ~Nay, <CHARNAME>. You will regret these words. In a year, if not tomorrow.~
@1189 = ~You are meant to be together with Xan. Only a blind man would deny that. But you cannot go on and keep the pain inside. You need a... a friend. And if it is to be pain for him, after you are gone, what will it matter?~
@1190 = ~You are too noble for your own good. I cannot accept this sacrifice.~
@1191 = ~You will find love, yet. I know it.~
@1192 = ~I gladly accept your friendship, Valygar.~
@1193 = ~I miss him. I miss him so much...~
@1194 = ~I will leave you alone, then. Should I?~
@1195 = ~Yes, please do.~
@1196 = ~No... don't.~
@1197 = ~Perhaps. Who knows what the future holds? But here and now, I worry for you.~
@1198 = ~You will always have it.~
@1199 = ~Shhh... I know. You will see him again.~
@1200 = ~As you wish.~
@1201 = ~Come. We should not lag behind like this.~
@1202 = ~Am I mistaken, <CHARNAME>, or do I see mischief in your eyes?~ [O#XAN000]
@1203 = ~I was wondering what Mazzy must be thinking of our friendship.~
@1204 = ~I was thinking of Anomen. I think he is jealous.~
@1205 = ~A little.~
@1206 = ~Well... perhaps!~
@1207 = ~You are mistaken, Valygar.~
@1208 = ~Mazzy and I are close friends. You know that.~
@1209 = ~Close friends do not plan to travel together.~
@1210 = ~I think she has feelings for you.~
@1211 = ~Does she know that you have no feelings for her?~
@1212 = ~All right, then.~
@1213 = ~Mazzy has been a true and loyal friend. She grieves for Patrick, she aids you in your quest, and she has no such feelings for me, or anyone.~
@1214 = ~Except Korgan. All right, I see your point.~
@1215 = ~I believe you, though I still have doubts.~
@1216 = ~And what about you?~
@1217 = ~Mazzy is a friend, <CHARNAME>. A friend. Come, I have taken enough of your time.~
@1218 = ~(sigh) Come, I have taken enough of your time.~
@1219 = ~He loves you.~
@1220 = ~He doesn't seem to show it.~
@1221 = ~I know. But what can I do?~
@1222 = ~And?~
@1223 = ~He has his pride. He knows whom your heart is given to.~
@1224 = ~Sooner or later, he will recover.~
@1225 = ~And you? Will you recover, Valygar?~
@1226 = ~I hope so. His pain doesn't bring me any comfort.~
@1227 = ~I wish I could recover as easily.~
@1228 = ~Everyone does, sooner or later. Come, I have taken enough of your time.~
@1229 = ~Hmm? What is the lady thinking of?~
@1230 = ~Mazzy. Do you think she is jealous?~
@1231 = ~Anomen. I think our cleric is sulking.~
@1232 = ~I think that despite everything, life is good.~
@1233 = ~I am simply enjoying your company and your friendship.~
@1234 = ~Ah... nothing in particular.~
@1235 = ~I am sorry.~
@1236 = ~Don't mind me, Valygar. I am not the best person to be around right now.~
@1237 = ~I am sorry, too.~
@1238 = ~Thank you. I feel better already.~
@1239 = ~You are.~
@1240 = ~It is good to know you feel better.~
@1241 = ~All thanks to you, Valygar.~
@1242 = ~Now you are smiling, too. It becomes you.~
@1243 = ~Believe it or not, but actually, I like it, too!~
@1244 = ~Dear words, my friend.~
@1245 = ~I do not know what else to say... but it is good to be next to you.~
@1246 = ~But it is painful, too, isn't it?~
@1247 = ~And it is good to be next to you, Valygar.~
@1248 = ~Thank you. I appreciate the sentiment.~
@1249 = ~I never regretted joining you, <CHARNAME>. Never.~
@1250 = ~I wish our travels took us back to Amn. This heat gets even to me.~ [O#XAN000]
@1251 = ~Amn is not a cold place, either.~
@1252 = ~Do you miss home?~
@1253 = ~I agree. Some cool air would be most welcome.~
@1254 = ~I actually like this climate.~
@1255 = ~Amn is not the best of places, but I miss it just the same. It will be good to return home.~
@1256 = ~Home? Will you be returning home, after this is over?~
@1257 = ~Yes, the Cowled Wizards will likely have missed you, too.~
@1258 = ~I will miss you, but I shall wish you the best just the same.~
@1259 = ~Thank you, <CHARNAME>.~
@1260 = ~I know that Athkatla will not welcome me. Still, this is where I prefer to be.~
@1261 = ~I hoped that you would travel with me for a while, first.~
@1262 = ~In your cabin in the woods? Or back in the Docks?~
@1263 = ~I do not want to part with you.~
@1264 = ~Can I come with you?~
@1265 = ~The Docks, I suppose. I haven't given it much thought.~
@1266 = ~Your destiny lies elsewhere. You know this.~
@1267 = ~What do you know of my destiny, Valygar?~
@1268 = ~Why does everyone assume to know my destiny better than me?~
@1269 = ~It does. But I'd hate to lose a friend because of it.~
@1270 = ~I have seen you and Xan. This is all there is to know.~
@1271 = ~You will lose nothing. Whatever happens, you will always have my friendship.~
@1272 = ~I would gladly travel with you for a while, if you allow me. But eventually we will all follow our separate paths.~
@1273 = ~I think I would like that.~
@1274 = ~... and I will see Xan again.~
@1275 = ~I will miss you.~
@1276 = ~It will end well, <CHARNAME>. Believe me.~
@1277 = ~You sleep peacefully these days.~ [O#XAN000]
@1278 = ~This is not a question.~
@1279 = ~If you wish to ask whether my dreams have stopped, then yes, they have.~
@1280 = ~I still have... visions.~
@1281 = ~I do not want to talk about it, Valygar.~
@1282 = ~I worry about you, and I watch you at nights, when I can. Last night, you were smiling.~
@1283 = ~Was I? Oh, now I am all embarrassed.~
@1284 = ~Yes, it shows that you *are* a stalker.~
@1285 = ~I had a good dream.~
@1286 = ~I did not want to embarrass you, and I am sorry. But you looked so peaceful that I wasn't able to draw my eyes away.~
@1287 = ~Thank you. It feels good to be thought about.~
@1288 = ~I know it is wrong, but I've had so much taken from me... I will not push you away.~
@1289 = ~I am becoming uncomfortable with this, Valygar. I am sorry.~
@1290 = ~I am glad.~
@1291 = ~I wish my words could undo the past, but at least they can brighten your future. As do your dreams.~
@1292 = ~Your presence is a great help, you know that? Thanks.~
@1293 = ~And Xan's diary.~
@1294 = ~And my other companions.~
@1295 = ~And everyone else, from the Solar to Saemon Havarian.~
@1296 = ~And my enemies, and the Five... We're all doomed, you know.~
@1297 = ~Once, I would have given everything to win your heart. Today, these simple words are all I need.~
@1298 = ~He will always be with you.~
@1299 = ~We are all here for you.~
@1300 = ~We are not.~
@1301 = ~Dark thoughts?~ [O#XAN000]
@1302 = ~Just thinking of the future.~
@1303 = ~No, I was focusing on our surroundings.~
@1304 = ~Some.~
@1305 = ~Why, yes, Valygar. How very perceptive of you.~
@1306 = ~You will get through the days ahead. One day at a time, or one hour at a time, if need be.~
@1307 = ~And I was thinking of you.~
@1308 = ~You are one of a kind, <CHARNAME>. Once, I would have hated your heritage, the foul magics your sire had granted you. You have changed me, and much more than only me - people and surroundings melt and alter around you.~
@1309 = ~You are a rare woman, and you deserve your victory.~
@1310 = ~I will not fail those who trust in me.~
@1311 = ~But it seems that I do not deserve love.~
@1312 = ~Thank you for the kind words, but I am still a Bhaalspawn.~
@1313 = ~Yes, I change everyone alright! By leading them to their deaths!~
@1314 = ~Whatever you do, you will have my blade and support. Time will reveal whether it is enough.~
@1315 = ~Do not let the guilt crush you down. One day, you will meet your lover again.~
@1316 = ~You are what you are. The Slayer is a part of you, and you have learnt to control it.~
@1317 = ~Whatever your origins, whatever your reputation, you are a great heroine. I have no doubt you will deal with your enemies, and perhaps even save us all.~
@1318 = ~I will try my best.~
@1319 = ~With you at my side.~
@1320 = ~Xan had been very optimistic just before Bodhi, too.~
@1321 = ~We shall make it through, and all will be well in the end. Togeth...~
@1322 = ~I pray you won't have to go through anything like that again.~
@1323 = ~So, this is it. Today, or tomorrow, or soon, it will be over.~ [O#XAN000]
@1324 = ~What are you trying to say?~
@1325 = ~Is this goodbye?~
@1326 = ~Not today, and not tomorrow. We still have things to do.~
@1327 = ~Still, this may be my last chance.~
@1328 = ~<CHARNAME>...~
@1329 = ~...~
@1330 = ~Yes?~
@1331 = ~It is best if we do not say anything.~
@1332 = ~Should I say anything?~
@1333 = ~Please do.~
@1334 = ~No... there is no need.~
@1335 = ~Only if you want to.~
@1336 = ~True. Besides, you know it all.~
@1337 = ~Let us go.~
@1338 = ~Be happy, <CHARNAME>. Be happy, and be loved. Fly across the Realms, across the planes, by whatever means possible. You've taught me that not all magic is to be feared.~
@1339 = ~And one day, you will be whole again.~
@1340 = ~Thank you, Valygar. For everything.~
@1341 = ~When it happens, I will let you know. Somehow.~
@1342 = ~I expected different words.~
@1343 = ~Thank you... for having been a part of my life.~
@1344 = ~Perhaps one day I will lift my head to the skies, and see you smiling at me from above. And then I will be content.~
@1345 = ~You know that I have no right to say them.~
@1346 = ~I will think of you.~
@1347 = ~And you, I think that you are happy, as well... Oh, look at you. Tell me, you intriguing little creature, what are you thinking? What do you think of?~
@1348 = ~(You fall into his arms weeping and clutching at his robes.)~
@1349 = ~<CHARNAME>... by the gods...~
