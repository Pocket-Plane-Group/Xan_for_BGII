@0    = ~We shall be rid of these two for a tenday. I almost want to sing...~
@1    = ~Athkatla? Safe? Have you tried walking the streets for a change?~
@2    = ~Whatever for? I know it is safe. Enough for me. Should be enough for you, as well.~
@3    = ~Pack? Shifting? <CHARNAME>, run! These are... these are...~
@4    = ~Let us away. There is nothing to be done. Perhaps you will encounter him later... no. Likely not. (sigh) I am sorry; let us go.~
@5    = ~Are all paladins as keen on sending their comrades into the fray?~
@6    = ~We are in luck. If it continues, they will get rid of each other for us.~
@7    = ~Ajantis? A sad day indeed.~
@8    = ~We stood together in battle, he trusted me with his life, and now his blood stains my hands! I knew him so well...~
@9    = ~The mysterious vampire the Council was in such ferment about! Not only shall you reach Imoen and Irenicus, but we will also perform an important task for my people - if we kill her.~
@10   = ~(sigh) 'If' is an important word here, of course.~
@11   = ~The mysterious vampire the Council was in such ferment about! Not only shall you reach Imoen and Irenicus, but we will also perform an important task for my people. If we ever return to Evereska, I may even tell them about it.~
@12   = ~I do not like it in the least. <CHARNAME>, are you sure? To the Abyss with Irenicus, I do not want you to perish as you will undoubtedly do. How do we travel there, in any case?~
@13   = ~Oh, I can tell you what comes. A hopeless task or two, then a mission where half of the party will perish, and finally, an elaborate trap. Hmm, are these items cursed, I wonder?~
@14   = ~No, of course not. The fact that <CHARNAME> is in even worse condition has apparently passed unnoticed, it seems.~
@15   = ~I was unaware of this. My sincere condolences to you, too, <CHARNAME>. I hope you can turn the situation to your advantage.~
@16   = ~Sometimes. More often, however, it is full of death, sadness and despair. (sigh) But at least the girl has found a guardian.~
@17   = ~So... so am I. The place reeks of pain... I cannot stand it. Screams in my head, whispers, pleas... <CHARNAME>, let us away, or I will faint.~
@18   = ~Of course, <CHARNAME> has nothing else to do but to run thieves' guilds. A habit of <PRO_HISHER>s, I might say.~
@19   = ~No, you have a minute, perhaps less. Honestly, do you expect <CHARNAME> to let you live after all you have done?~
@20   = ~How convenient. One may even think he knew when we were going to return, and was aware of whatever happened to Raelis. Are you sure that you are not an extraplanar being, my dear sir?~
@21   = ~Business is the same on any plane. My interests are here, and I'm trying to serve the best I can.~
@22   = ~Now, can we finally return to the road? (sigh) I cannot believe I am saying this...~
@23   = ~And, of course, our demise will miraculously heal her. (sigh) Impeccable logic, no doubt.~
@24   = ~A betrayal? From you, Keldorn, of all people? Why? Why would you doom us now?~
@25   = ~No more nefarious than... than... Don't you see what she is?!~
@26   = ~So, we are working for her, after all. I do hope you know what you are doing.~
@27   = ~Thank the Seldarine for that. If you accepted this woman's proposal... I do not think I could stand it.~
@28   = ~Of interest?! He tortured her!~
@29   = ~Skill? Nothing justifies torture, neither skill nor intent. Once on the rack, you will understand it... but it will be far, far too late.~
@30   = ~Aye, many said that. Some of 'em came to me rack, later... one was a pretty lass, that's fer shore...~
@31   = ~Now we are in trouble. Big trouble, I would say. <CHARNAME>, do you really need the ring that badly?~
@32   = ~Pay - for the souls of your men? What is going on here?~
@33   = ~Lovely. Eloquent techniques of courtship at work. (sigh) I only hope I was not as violent when courting you.~
@34   = ~Your mate has already paid for his! Now it is their turn!~
@35   = ~This filth... one of us? No. It cannot be.~
@36   = ~No? Didn't they tell you, poor dear?~
@37   = ~Great warrior? You haven't changed at all, I see.~
@38   = ~Coran! That's enough out of you!~
@39   = ~Irenicus, Bodhi, inmates, dragons, drow, and now Drizzt. (groan) We are doomed.~
@40   = ~I can vouch for my friend. Is - all this - absolutely necessary?~ [O#XAN189]
@41   = ~Perhaps not, but we are all hard pressed in this difficult time. I apologize, but you will come to see that it is in all our best interests.~ [ELHAN107]
@42   = ~These are dire news. <CHARNAME>, our quest is now of double urgency, I am afraid.~
@43   = ~But we are free... we are ourselves again... we are together. If I look upwards, I will see the sky...~
@44   = ~(cough)~
@45   = ~Ah. Oh. Never mind. I have been carried away again, it seems.~
@46   = ~And we approach the subject of their gear. Not good at all. Who are you, if I may ask?~
@47   = ~By the Seldarine, I think I am going to kill him myself!~
@48   = ~What have you turned into, Faldorn? You are raving mad.~
@49   = ~Ha! You do not know true madness, worm!~
@50   = ~No "death to the enemies of nature", then? I must say, you have changed your allegiance remarkably quickly.~
@51   = ~See? A mindless slave. Thanks to your perfect choice, we shall all become such - in time.~
@52   = ~Why, thank you. Now, if we are killed, it will be within the law. How grand.~
@53   = ~What does approval equal to in the City of Coin, I wonder? And what happens to those who fail to comply? Though... no, do not answer. The last one is painfully obvious.~
@54   = ~Too true. And especially so since in a moment or two, <CHARNAME> will suddenly get a whim to investigate this madness.~
@55   = ~(sigh)~
@56   = ~A fine start of our journey. I do hope we will not be forced to feed slaves to spiders, next.~
@57   = ~And serves you right. (cough) Lolth be praised, of course.~
@58   = ~This is what awaits us, if you misstep. Not a pleasant way to go at all.~
@59   = ~Do you truly think you will survive? <CHARNAME>, giving these people hope was foolish. But perhaps... perhaps.~
@60   = ~Then he is doomed. Humans ever preferred gold to their own lives, and this one will be no different.~
@61   = ~Legendary, inspiring, epic - does it matter at all? What does is that <PRO_HESHE> is alive!~
@62   = ~With another suicidal mission, I do not doubt.~
@63   = ~Envious? Why, of course they would be, with such a magnificent example before their eyes. Why do you work for the Shadow Thieves at all, Edwin? I would have thought that you'd move on into the Council of Six at the very least.~
@64   = ~Pathetic rulers of this forsaken city do not concern me. The Cowled Wizards, however, are another matter entirely.~
@65   = ~This is madness! <CHARNAME> is dying, what is the sense in delay?~
@66   = ~An interesting subject to study. I see. <CHARNAME>, unless you wish to find yourself in a cage yet again, I suggest that we back off. Slowly.~
@67   = ~Of course. Wherever <CHARNAME> goes, there is an artifact and a mission which awaits <PRO_HIMHER> and <PRO_HIMHER> alone. How convenient. You will delay the plucking of our eyes until our return, I presume.~
@68   = ~Shadowmaster. (sigh) Ah well. It is better than heading straight to Irenicus, in any case.~
@69   = ~Ah, I see where it is going. This man will blackmail you, so you will help him regain his lands, and he will clear your name in return. Truly, there is no charity in this world.~
@70   = ~But of course we did, foolish boy! I remember you well, I assure you. You did well in leaving the Life: this way, you will live longer.~
@71   = ~Eager to die, you mean? (sigh) Of course. Why do I even bother?~
@72   = ~How true. However, while his words are wise, I do not believe it is sane to call an armed opponent 'my son' in a heated debate. Rather, it is suicidal.~
@73   = ~Pay attention, <CHARNAME>: while shy, diplomatic adventurers like us have to resort to all sorts of tricks to gain admittance into the so-called 'back rooms', a jealous wife is able to achieve the desired result in an instant. Alas, her methods are a touch too... expressive.~
@74   = ~For the third and final time: you will return what you have stolen! Death would be a mercy to one such as you.~ [O#XAN190]
@75   = ~Finally! And it is worth to mention that we are alive, as well. Ah, I almost do not believe it...~
@76   = ~Oh, but when ruling a place such as this, you will find it necessary to relax your moral principles, and soon.~
@77   = ~There will be no slaves in the Copper Coronet from now on! I shall not allow it. But you are right, friend, the slavers are many.~
@78   = ~I do not blame you. They are not exactly friendly, are they?~
@79   = ~No, my lord. Oh, no.~
@80   = ~Illithid! On the loose in Athkatla, alive and thriving! <CHARNAME>, we should avoid the sewers from now on.~
@81   = ~But of course. It could be no other way, could it?~
@82   = ~<CHARNAME>, run, or stand behind me! A Demilich form... he will imprison us all!~
@83   = ~We. Are. Doomed.~
@84   = ~But what you have done to deserve such punishment?~
@85   = ~I was subjected to eternity of torture! No crime deserves such a curse!~
@86   = ~I cannot believe it. They were doomed, they had no hope, but here they are, alive, well and laughing. It is incredible.~
@87   = ~Knowing our leader, <PRO_HESHE> just might.~
@88   = ~Oh. <CHARNAME>, much as I regret this, we have to kill him, and now.~
@89   = ~Famous last words...~
@90   = ~Do you need us to tell you? Run!~
@91   = ~Certainly. And should someone ask, I believe that we have never met you at all?~
@92   = ~I see you are one of a like mind, my friend. Yes, you've never seen me at all.~
@93   = ~Knowing you and your former associates' temper, I can safely predict there are but corpses there.~
@94   = ~Har! Aye, 'tis be like Shagbag... but I'll get his stinkin' hide, I will.~
@95   = ~Yes, hope is a fragile feeling, isn't it? And pointless, as well. What are we to do?~
@96   = ~Finally! If it means there'll be no more day marches to this dreary place, I owe you my eternal gratitude.~
@97   = ~I would like to know that myself. Trolls are incapable of casting charm spells, every student of magic knows this much. So what happened to you?~
@98   = ~I do not remember... I saw a pair of large yellow eyes and a snakelike body, and then everything went black...~
@99   = ~Does anything ever go right with your possessions, <CHARNAME>?~
@100  = ~I must say, the man has a point.~
@101  = ~Your friend here understands implicitly, I see.~
@102  = ~Thank Corellon, it is over. It is strange, however, that a kind, benevolent deity like Lathander demanded blood from one of his ilk.~
@103  = ~The Talassans were corrupted and evil, my good man. It is natural that Lathander desired retribution, and that his clergy were called upon to perform the task.~
@104  = ~Ah, I see: they were evil, so they deserved it.~
@105  = ~So they did! But enough of this.~
@106  = ~Abominations all. <CHARNAME>, you will regret this pact, mark my words.~
@107  = ~Oh, yes. Alas, years of pain are far more capable of bringing out the good in a man than the pleas of his victims or the severity of the law. (sigh) It is an ironical world.~
@108  = ~Oh, yes. Alas, years of pain are far more capable of bringing out the good in a man than the pleas of his victims or the severity of the law. (sigh) It is an ironical world.~
@109  = ~Oh, yes. There are ever slaves to be freed, heroic deeds to be performed, and many, many new opportunities to get us killed.~
@110  = ~Idiots both, but this one is an abomination, as well. Back to the grave with you, zombie! Enough undead here as it is.~
@111  = ~You cannot help him, <CHARNAME>. You will only endanger us all. I am sorry.~
@112  = ~I do hope we are NOT to complete another pointless quest for this drunkard's bartab. I really do.~
@113  = ~Pleasant? Soon, this 'benevolent' organization will descend to the level of the Zhentarim. Murderous, deceitful and manipulative - they are all doomed.~
@114  = ~Xzar? I thought you perished months ago.~
@115  = ~As you see, I did not. Why an inept apprentice like you is still alive, though, is beyond me.~
@116  = ~Try it, and you will see your own men tearing you to pieces! Leave her alone!~
@117  = ~Ah, perhaps you wish to writhe under red-hot pincers next to her?~
@118  = ~(groan) Another assassination, of course. Hmm... perhaps Edwin will ask us to kill Mae'Var, this time? I will not say 'no' to it, mind you.~
@119  = ~Is it finally over? Thank the Seldarine! I think I am going to kiss the woman, so grateful I am that we are still alive!~
@120  = ~Oh.~
@121  = ~On the other hand, perhaps not.~
@122  = ~I do hope you are looking for information, and nothing else. (sigh) Somehow, however, I doubt it.~
@123  = ~Perhaps... perhaps we should leave, <CHARNAME>. This is an intimate matter...~
@124  = ~A creature from the Negative Energy Plane? How?~
@125  = ~Now you are *asking* for trouble.~
@126  = ~Why do we always end up trusting in Lady Luck?~
@127  = ~First and foremost, we trust in ourselves. Don't we, mother?~
@128  = ~No, you shall not. We have no quarrel with you, but since <CHARNAME>'s foolish behavior provoked a fight yet again, I shall do my best.~
@129  = ~And, of course, no reward. Typical.~
@130  = ~Oh, but what am I talking about? I have started to think just like you do: rewards and riches! Seldarine, what is happening to me?~
@131  = ~Ah, so the Cowled Wizards possess flexible morality. But what of Tolgerias? Is he to be simply discarded?~
@132  = ~It is a near miracle that anyone survived at all. The tasks you assigned to these children were nothing short of suicidal.~
@133  = ~Do you really care about their fate? Well, if you must...~
@134  = ~A finger? We could all die here!~
@135  = ~Despicable. Why would a man want to sink so low?~
@136  = ~I had a problem childhood, mate. Nobody understood me... (hic!) No one...~
@137  = ~Following the local law is your best course of action, Nalia. I am sure there is a way to cancel your engagement.~
@138  = ~You do not understand! Isaea IS the law! He threatens, blackmails and bribes, so I have no chance to get rid of him!~
@139  = ~I remember him! The child-killer from Baldur's Gate! He must have escaped from the Flaming Fist's quarters!~
@140  = ~So I did, so I did! Seize them, my children, so they would tell no one!~
@141  = ~(shudder) Safety and longevity at such price? No. Never.~
@142  = ~Noble, wise and stoic men, doomed to wandering and death among strangers. It is a sad world we live in.~
@143  = ~Is he afraid of his own men?~
@144  = ~You will make an impression of him soon enough, and I advise you to make a good one on him, if you get my meaning. Aran does not tolerate fools.~
@145  = ~I have seen many cases like this. But why did you have to suffer in the stead of your father?~
@146  = ~Partaking of delights, you said? Well, good luck to you... if you are serious, that is. I harbor a selfish desire, however, that you are not.~
@147  = ~The Slayer... the avatar of Bhaal. I knew it would happen sooner or later. Seldarine help us, <CHARNAME>, now you are as much a danger to us as you are to yourself.~
@148  = ~Not this... not you... not ever...~
@149  = ~No, hysteria won't help now. Lead... lead on. We shall talk later.~
@150  = ~The horror... and I dared to think that - ~
@151  = ~No. It is over.~
@152  = ~Madmen, to help us in this battle! If we survive Irenicus, it will be nothing short of a miracle.~
@153  = ~Step back, <CHARNAME>. If these madmen want to attack you, they will have to face me and my magic, first.~
@154  = ~At last! Is it over? He is dead, and you are... free?~
@155  = ~Of all places, you brought us here! Are we even alive? (groan) No matter. We are doomed.~ [O#XAN191]
@156  = ~You shall not play with her as if she is your toy, creature!~
@157  = ~Who will stop me? You? I take what I want. Perhaps I will take you, too, when the time comes.~
@158  = ~He does not seem in control of himself, <CHARNAME>. Step aside...~
@159  = ~That itself is a very clear indication of madness, trust me on this.~
@160  = ~I have seen him somewhere. I do not remember...~
@161  = ~Regardless, he does not deserve, cannot deserve this terrible place. None of them does.~
@162  = ~<CHARNAME>, beautiful... leave her. We shall help her later, I promise, but we must find your tormentor, first.~
@163  = ~I am sure that <PRO_HESHE> already understands much more than you would wish <PRO_HIMHER> to.~
@164  = ~Run! Run, foolish girl! Now!~ [O#XAN192]
@165  = ~Ha! The other Shadow Thieves would not go quietly, either.~ [IRENIC83]
@166  = ~The worst fate available. Even if you stake him, he will never find peace, only darkness. Now I understand what the true doom looks like.~
@167  = ~I suspect that soon, we shall call him by the same name. He looks like a rat about to abandon the sinking ship.~
@168  = ~I assure you, it is wisdom and not cowardice.~
@169  = ~It will do me good to see your body hanging from the gallows, scoundrel!~
@170  = ~Your wrath is misguided, my friend, as I can well explain.~
@171  = ~The Underdark or a sea voyage. Under *your* command. Why, thank you. A perfect offer.~
@172  = ~And, of course, the ship is well guarded, and you need some artifact to steer it. Do you think we can do it, tired as we are?~
@173  = ~'Tis a matter of importance, but I am willing to wait for a day, if you agree to my proposal.~
@174  = ~Now we are truly doomed.~
@175  = ~Do not look at me like that, I know that I have said it before! But now we are!~
@176  = ~Bodhi. Who else?~
@177  = ~Still mad, I see. And no wonder, that. But perhaps he is happiest here.~
@178  = ~Violent and dangerous. (sigh) As well as can be expected.~
@179  = ~Another battle. And we are tired and battered already...~
@180  = ~Oh? Quayle? I say, you have changed quite a bit.~
@181  = ~Shut up and listen!~
@182  = ~Ah, intrigue, betrayals and mind games. If only you had a century or two to understand the futility of it all... but of course, you do not. You will continue drenching this place in blood until you die.~
@183  = ~Please, do not continue. Say anything else, but not what you are about to say. Find someone else to kill - ~
@184  = ~Now, now, there is no cause for panic.~
@185  = ~So well known that some want to end the unstoppable tide of <PRO_HISHER>... wrongdoings?~
@186  = ~Ah, but we have no quarrel with <CHARNAME>, I assure you.~
@187  = ~Alas, the avatar of your half-dead god seems to have the same suicidal tendencies as our exalted leader.~
@188  = ~See, <CHARNAME>? Will you continue to lust for the power your heritage provides, after what you have seen here? There is no point, save unrest and loathing.~
@189  = ~My people are truly on the wane, if they had to resort to such simple tricks to hide a holy relic. Pathetic...~
@190  = ~Everything fades, everything dies, everything lies forgotten. Why do we try to restore the balance here? In a millennia, it shall be irrelevant.~
@191  = ~Here was the home of my children and my mate! Fly, fool, if you are scared. I shall make my last stand against whatever has come from the temple's depths!~
@192  = ~Oh, I shall. <CHARNAME>, I rarely make such proposals, but if you wish this ruffian to wail in despair for the next few hours, you need but say a word.~
@193  = ~Do you want to commit another murder in cold blood? Or to be killed yourself? <CHARNAME>, you are too young to die here and now, don't you understand?~
@194  = ~So, they want to eat us. I expected nothing less.~
@195  = ~Surely, we have enough treasure as it is, don't we? <CHARNAME>?~
@196  = ~(sigh) We do not, I see. Very well, go on.~
@197  = ~It's a trap, I am almost certain... another devious trap.~
@198  = ~We play fair, big people! We will save you!~
@199  = ~Imprisoned by sahuagin... the shark-men... (groan) We *are* doomed.~
@200  = ~You speak ill of your King. It is not that I disagree, but I thought you were acting under his orders, were you not?~
@201  = ~I have no other choice but to disobey, surfacer. Listen and decide for yourself.~
@202  = ~I cannot watch this. Will we be next?~
@203  = ~Did you hear that, <CHARNAME>? The throne is important. Our lives are clearly not.~
@204  = ~No more than my people suffered and died when the ships to Evermeet were devoured by your despicable brethren! And what of malenti, face-changers, who pretended to be honest sea-elves? You killed many, without reason, so do not be surprised when the fortune turns its back on you, as it turned on my brethren years ago! Fling your accusations, they deter no one!~
@205  = ~You will pay, surfacers. One day, you will pay!~
@206  = ~Now, this is a relief. For one horrible moment, I thought... but never mind.~
@207  = ~I wonder, what would you do if the gentleman agreed? I'd be better off not knowing, I suspect.~
@208  = ~Forgive my intrusion, but if you cannot pass through a certain door, neither can <CHARNAME>.~
@209  = ~Oh, I am sure there is one device or another you will find. I, however, failed, and will not risk it again.~
@210  = ~Now, if I have no Emotion spells left, we are in deep trouble indeed...~
@211  = ~A safe way? (groan) Please...~
@212  = ~<CHARNAME>, do not tell me that we are going down below to retrieve both of these artifacts and reassemble this... this...~
@213  = ~The rod is an artifact of immense power and danger, my lord.~
@214  = ~Exactly.~
@215  = ~From Baldur's Gate? Is it another acquaintance of ours? I hope not; Amn is crowded with our former adversaries as it is.~
@216  = ~Oh, yes. Yes. Not exactly illithium, though. Rather, a beautiful woman standing next to me... but the rest is better left unsaid.~
@217  = ~Oh dear.~
@218  = ~So, it worked out in the end. I wondered.~
@219  = ~Such is the fate of every human wizard as they grow old: a grey-haired entertainer in some backwater tavern. But at least, they do grow old.~
@220  = ~(gulp) NO! ...oh, I am sorry, <CHARNAME>. I got carried away. But the thing is so... repulsive...~
@221  = ~Do we take him by surprise or do you take *us* by surprise? This attempt to lure <CHARNAME> out of the guild building is so poorly masked it is not even amusing.~
@222  = ~I am sure <CHARNAME> will not disappoint by acting out of cowardice. The matter is of utmost importance and will determine <PRO_HISHER> standing in the Guild hierarchy.~
@223  = ~We are powerful enough to oppose this band, but these thugs have superiors. What do we do, <CHARNAME>?~
@224  = ~An interesting insight into the Amnish justice system, I am sure. But I fear - no, rather, I am happy to announce - that we are not the soldiers of Amn.~
@225  = ~Most likely, we will never see him again. <CHARNAME> is left with a remarkable bruise, however.~
@226  = ~Certainly... ah, venerable one. <CHARNAME>, weren't you told that the second floor was dangerous? I thought your hearing ability was better than this.~
@227  = ~This is madness! Once an Exile, forever an Exile, especially after these atrocities! Corellon would never - ~
@228  = ~True, alas. One look at <CHARNAME>'s fading form is enough.~
@229  = ~But why were the Exiles allowed to walk free with the power they possessed?~
@230  = ~It is too late to muse on what has already been done. That the Exile lives, and threatens us all, is what we should focus on.~
@231  = ~Stop this madness, <CHARNAME>! Whatever follies they have done in the past, now is not the time to argue!~
@232  = ~No longer. The first time he failed, but he nourished his grudges for too long. No one can stop him now.~
@233  = ~No one, save you and your companions.~
@234  = ~And there are more children across the city. Would that we could save them all... but I know we cannot.~
@235  = ~They are dying even as we speak... and these are people I have sworn to protect...~
@236  = ~Then, I trust, you will not fail me. My guards will assist you in evacuating people, but your main target is the palace.~
@237  = ~(shudder) I could not agree more.~
@238  = ~So we shall. <CHARNAME>'s spirit hangs in the balance, and <PRO_HESHE> will not last long without it. It seems that <PRO_HESHE> is fading even now; we must hurry. Thank you for your assistance.~
@239  = ~You have proven worthy of it. May the spirits of the Seldarine aid you.~
@240  = ~(sigh) If only it could help...~
@242  = ~Kobolds... again. (shudder) I had enough of them during my former imprisonment. <CHARNAME>, let us away... please.~
@243  = ~Hmmm... Who could it be, I wonder?~
@244  = ~No matter! They shall be the first to fall, once Talos reveals me the truth!~
@245  = ~I... I see. <CHARNAME>, are you still thinking of making purchases?~
@246  = ~Mindless fanatics...~
@247  = ~Oh, it is nothing, <CHARNAME>. I was simply, mmm... thinking aloud. My apologies.~
@248  = ~Yes, the item is disgusting, and yes, we all know it will lead to battle. But perhaps - only as a hypothetical suggestion, mind you - we may part peacefully?~
@249  = ~I do not mind, really. A peaceful person, me. But some people do.~
@250  = ~Here goes the villain's exposition again. Shall we call the guards, or simply wait until he summons his allies and skins us all?~
@251  = ~(sigh) We just had to take this route, didn't we?~
@252  = ~We should be thankful he did not resurrect Sarevok, Davaeorn, and Rieltar to create a full impression. One ogre we can manage... if no one is to resurrect him again, of course.~
@253  = ~I am all for that! Revenge Firkraag wants, and revenge I will have!~
@254  = ~Oh, he was not that bad when we encountered him a year ago. Much can change in a year, though.~
@255  = ~Weapons at the ready once again, I presume. Can't we solve a single matter without a fight?~
@256  = ~Once having betrayed, you will do so again, given a motive. Why should <PRO_HESHE> trust you?~
@257  = ~Your money is guarantee enough. Ployer is destitute.~
@258  = ~Back, <CHARNAME>! He is about to attack!~
@259  = ~So, as if it was not enough that they demanded a large sum, now they want to help us out of what little we have left? Very generous, I see.~
@260  = ~Ah! You're working for us against... Ahhhh... I see. I have heard of you. No, your leader shouldn't worry: nobody will touch <PRO_HISHER> purse, if they do not want to wind up in the gutter with their teeth knocked out. We do not harm our own.~
@261  = ~Indeed. Be careful, <CHARNAME>. For your sake, if not for the well-being of your companions.~
@262  = ~Running, running, running... the girl will be dead well before we are done!~
@263  = ~None of my fault, mate. It's Him. You gotta obey if you want to stay alive.~
@264  = ~Human cruelty knows no bounds. But at least you are alive for the time being.~
@265  = ~Better a simple woman than a rash paladin, I suppose. Though some prefer mages... mmm... don't you, <CHARNAME>?~
@266  = ~Of course, it always comes down to money. (sigh) Humans...~
@267  = ~<CHARNAME>, we have more pressing matters to attend to than tinkering with lethal devices! Or do you not trust Irenicus and Bodhi to destroy you properly?~
@268  = ~If you value your given word, do not taint it. Refuse; who knows what they may ask you to do.~
@269  = ~Invigorating indeed. Some of us still scream at night, so very invigorating it was.~
@270  = ~Ah... er...~
@271  = ~<CHARNAME>, do you see the spittle coming out of his mouth? He is clearly deranged.~
@272  = ~Mind your betters, peasant! I am talking to your leader.~
@273  = ~They both are. Why don't we get out of her house, and leave them to their own squabbles?~
@274  = ~(groan) Didn't I tell you? It simply could not end well!~
@275  = ~They both are. Why don't we get out of his house, and leave them to their own squabbles?~
@276  = ~I have a bad feeling about this. He'll ask us to hunt this rakshasa next.~
@277  = ~A cunning mortal you are, are you not? Yes, Dao would be very interested in having this rakshasa's head, very interested indeed!~
@278  = ~She will not, creature, and I well advise you not to approach her with such proposals again, lest you get something more than a polite refusal.~
@279  = ~Ha ha! Poor little mortal you are! Poor jealous mortal... go on, go on.~
@280  = ~What... what has this crone said to you? She is shaking, and you...~
@281  = ~Do not let her frighten you. You are stronger than this. I know you are.~
@282  = ~Trademeet without trade? How ironic. That is akin to Athkatla without coin, or Evereska without her walls.~
@283  = ~No longer, due to your intervention. Now the trade routes and connections are restored.~
@284  = ~Only to myself and never in danger. How... how true.~
@285  = ~A year ago, I would have found his behavior ridiculous. Now, however, I don't know. I would boast and brag only to win your smile... oh, I am losing my head with you...~
@286  = ~The story suspiciously reminds me of something our Helmite friend would tell. Are you sure it is not a long-lost relative of yours, Anomen?~
@287  = ~This miserable wretch has nothing to do with the name Delryn! Watch your tongue before spouting random accusations! Now, the Hillgnasher Giants, on the other hand...~
@288  = ~Regrets will not help in this matter. You left the girl to die, and dead she is.~
@289  = ~No! No... please, I know she is alive!~
@290  = ~Wait. Why not simply deliver the man into custody?~
@291  = ~No! He will kill us all! You must kill him!~
@292  = ~Wherever we go, we are bound to encounter another Shadow Thief. Are we being followed, I wonder?~
@293  = ~Your progress is closely watched, it is true, but we mean you no harm.~
@294  = ~Duelling, fighting, killing - have we not done enough outside the city walls? I hoped that as a leader, you will ensure our survival, not plunge us into another reckless affair.~
@295  = ~Indeed, the opportunities to die in this city are many. Veldrin, are you truly interested in another one?~
@296  = ~Your leader is showing promise in seeking approval of <PRO_HISHER> prowess. Be wise, male, and step aside.~
@297  = ~(groan) Why, why did you have to go and mention that? Now <PRO_HESHE> will spend months there, until the Handmaidens finally drag <PRO_HIMHER> out and flog <PRO_HIMHER> for <PRO_HISHER> disobedience.~
@298  = ~Besides... I would be jealous to see you there, Veldrin... <CHARNAME>. I cannot help but think that you are my, and only my love... whatever the circumstances are.~
@299  = ~What?.. <CHARNAME>... Veldrin, stop him!~
@300  = ~Nightmare after nightmare... I shudder at the thought. But what for? Did they take enjoyment in your suffering?~
@301  = ~Caught between an angry Silver and an all-powerful Matron Mother. <CHARNAME>, how is it that we always end up in a hopeless situation?~
@302  = ~Illithids. We are captured by tentacled monsters, whose favorite entertainment is devouring brains! (groan) I lost consciousness before I could notice our captors, but how I wish I was still in the dark...~
@303  = ~No... by all that is holy, no! If we do not stop it, my people are doomed! Why, why would the madman want to unleash such horror?~
@304  = ~(groan) No...~
@305  = ~Then further conversation is pointless. If we are to kill you, so we shall.~
@306  = ~You are now free, but we are doomed to suffer here. Or do you intend to free us, as well?~
@307  = ~From this moment on, we shall be watched night and day. Let us not disappoint the Matron Mothers, shall we?~
@308  = ~Safely? Do you even know what are you talking about? Meddling in psionics and plane traveling is never safe!~
@309  = ~You would do well to follow your leader in silence, male. As I said, you are still no better than a slave.~
@310  = ~What for? To betray us, just as you turned your back on the woman who was tortured because of you?~
@311  = ~Phaere caused more pain than you know. Do not speak of what you do not understand.~
@312  = ~Ah, yes. Once the deed is done, you offer condolences and sympathy. I wonder whether you would dare to come and offer healing if none of us escaped these pits!~
@313  = ~We are not merciless folk, but we cannot face such evil. I am sorry for the risks you had to take, but let us not ruin our pact with unpleasantries.~
@314  = ~As always, the former victim is far from exploding with gratitude. Why you bothered in the first place is beyond me.~
@315  = ~Do not get your hopes up: it is the Underdark, after all. I am sure that your eventual fate will be much, much worse.~
@316  = ~And something tells me that your risks are far from over, stranger. Judging by the look in <CHARNAME>'s eyes, you would do well to leave empty-handed, and quietly.~
@317  = ~No, of course not. 'Humble' is not the word. 'Lively', more like. Crowded with rats and other... species. I expected no less.~
@318  = ~Real men? Do you mean "gutted like pigs by the first gibberling they met"? <CHARNAME>, leave them be. Let them live.~
@319  = ~Wonderful. Dying for the benefit of some forsaken village - isn't it what I have always dreamed of?~
@320  = ~Please, do not tell me that you are about to worm your way into our party. Anything but this...~
@321  = ~I am not opposed to you yet, darthiir. Do not interrupt me if you do not wish us to come as enemies.~
@322  = ~(groan) Another ambush. I am so tired of this...~
@323  = ~<CHARNAME>, get away from him. His madness might be contagious.~
@324  = ~See, <CHARNAME>? See what your allies are capable of? How I wish you could change your allegiance...~
@325  = ~See, <CHARNAME>? See what our enemies are capable of? Best be wary when walking the streets at night... if at all.~
@326  = ~This is worse than I have thought. Look at these marks, <CHARNAME>. Suspicious indeed, isn't it?~
@327  = ~Of course. Come, <CHARNAME>, I am sure you can do better than approaching drunken ne'er-do-wells in the little time that we have left.~
@328  = ~You DARE? You... you... you pointy-eared trash!~
@329  = ~Pleased to make your acquaintance, madam.~
@330  = ~You will touch her over my dead body, rogue! You have caused enough harm as is.~ [O#XAN193]
@331  = ~I... I am sorry. I have no choice in the matter. No choice...~ [YOSHIM71]
@332  = ~Beg your god's forgiveness, Yoshimo. From me, you will get none.~
@333  = ~Excellent. The Shadow Thieves want you dead, and we are to get you out of this mess. Are you sure that no other group hunts you? Cowled Wizards, perhaps, or Irenicus himself? Feel free to share your suspicions.~
@334  = ~Er... nothing of the sort, friend, I assure you. But I am sure our brave leader does not mind it as much, yes?~
@335  = ~Foolish boy, what has she done to you? Was it she who killed your sister?~
@336  = ~She is no innocent, I tell you. None of this family is. Say what you will, not even the Order will tell me differently! All of these dogs will die!~
@337  = ~I suppose you seem like good enough folk. You probably need a blacksmith quite often with all that armor, right? Well... fine. I can sell you what I have, if you like.~
@338  = ~I have been made many strange offers, but being tempted with my own stolen robe tops them all. For a simple blacksmith, you have quite the gall.~
@339  = ~Ah... this robe?~
@340  = ~Yes. This robe. My Robe of Archmagi, to be precise. I will probably die tomorrow and never notice, but still, I would like it back, if you please.~
@341  = ~If - if you would listen, sir... these were difficult times, you understand... I had to enter an agreement with the Shadow Thieves here, in Trademeet. I was to put up some of their items for sale, and they supported my family in return. With those Dao, it was horrible... nothing to eat... I cannot simply return your robe. I have to pay them their share. If I do not, they will come for me!~
@342  = ~(sigh) How much?~
@343  = ~Five thousand gold.~
@344  = ~<CHARNAME>?~
@345  = ~Five thousand for Xan's Robe of Archmagi? Very well, here you go.~
@346  = ~No, we do not have the money.~
@347  = ~I will not spend my money on this. Come, Xan.~
@348  = ~That's ridiculous! It belongs to Xan, hand it over!~
@349  = ~Then the robe is yours. A pleasure doing business with you, <PRO_SIRMAAM>.~
@350  = ~Why, thank you, <CHARNAME>... I suppose. Somehow, I have doubts that I'll be allowed to wear it again.~
@351  = ~And even if I do, it will not help. Doomed I am, and doomed I will be.~
@352  = ~A pity. Come back when you have the money. I will still sell it to you, if you like.~
@353  = ~Try to pry it by force, and Trademeet's militia will hunt you down! No, <PRO_SIRMAAM>, it is five thousand or nothing.~
@354  = ~Very well. Take the money.~
@355  = ~Then nothing it is. Goodbye.~
@356  = ~I will not let it pass! Lord Logan will know of this!~
@357  = ~I am a honest blacksmith, you cannot prove anything! I was more than happy to help you out, but now I see that I have made a mistake. Please, leave my shop. I don't want any trouble.~
@358  = ~I am sorry, but you do not have enough gold. Come back when you have the money.~
@359  = ~I am sorry, but I cannot give it to you until you bring forth the rightful owner of this robe.~
@360  = ~I would like to purchase that robe you mentioned.~
@361  = ~Your eyes will close before the harp is unstrung, and magic turns wild. Cherish the time that is given, elf.~
@362  = ~(sigh) For once, could you not lie and say that you expected me to live a long, fruitful life?~
@363  = ~<CHARNAME>, are you all right at all? Can you hear me? Here... lean on me before you fall.~
@364  = ~Yes, thank you. It helps. It does.~
@365  = ~I wasn't going to fall! I just felt dizzy for a moment.~
@366  = ~I felt strange... as if I was not in control of my senses.~
@367  = ~I cannot imagine how you are going to lead us out in such a state. Perhaps we should sit down and thoroughly enjoy our last moments instead of this senseless fighting, no? But it is up to you, of course. Come, let us go.~
@368  = ~As you wish. But be careful, will you?~
@369  = ~This is indeed strange. What exactly has Irenicus done to you when we were imprisoned, I wonder? What rituals, what incantations? I wish I knew for sure... but never mind. You may yet live... if we escape fast enough, that is.~
@370  = ~What is it, melamin? You are shaking...~
@371  = ~Something is very wrong... Xan, get away. I... cannot... control myself...~
@372  = ~What do you think it can be? The Slayer is coming alive, idiot! Run!~
@373  = ~Nothing at all. Just a nice little Slayer. Lean closer, dearest - ~
@374  = ~Your lips move, but I hear nothing. Are you well? Can I... No - NOT AGAIN!~
@375  = ~I am still alive, if you are interested. What for, though? To start getting ready for the next time, whenever it comes?~
@376  = ~No matter. Able or not, I prefer the clean death at Irenicus' hands to the slow torture in yours.~
@377  = ~A'maelamin... why do we have to suffer so?~
@378  = ~You follow in the hopes of retrieving something dear to you. I say that the longer you keep this up, the more you will lose.~
@379  = ~Ah, you have done the job yourself. I hope you do not mind if I take the body: my children do not feed on carrion, but perhaps some ghouls will.~
@380  = ~Now... it is done.~
@381  = ~Now, what do I see? An elven brother, and with a moonblade, no less! Come. Come to me, and you will become my brother in full.~
@382  = ~Give up the Lanthorn, creature, and you will live another day.~
@383  = ~Should I? No, I am afraid not. But you feel the pull, do you? The darkness calls to you... come. Come slowly... a delicacy such as a moonblade wielder cannot be hurried.~
@384  = ~No...~
@385  = ~I shall die here and now, but you will not have my spirit! Ithilmegil, tua amin!~
@386  = ~Such a disappointment... but we shall not let this little thing ruin our meeting, shall we?~ [O#XAN000]
@387  = ~The tide has certainly changed for me! Xan is dead!~
@388  = ~It is a heavy blow. Moonfighters are scarce and few these days, and he was of noble blood. Yet, Irenicus took many lives, and your friend's passing will not be the last.~
@389  = ~There will be more to come. Though hopefully not between you and I: our alliance may prove crucial.~ [ELHAN108]
@390  = ~Xan, a Greycloak of Evereska, who joined forces with you to destroy Bodhi and her coven. He looks at the stairs with a mix of revulsion and fear, but when he straightens, his face is resolute.~
@391  = ~Xan, you have been with me from the very start. It is time for you to go and live your own life.~
@392  = ~There are no vampires in Athkatla now, Xan. Your mission is complete, and Evereska awaits.~
@393  = ~Xan, I know it is dangerous, but I need your help. I may not survive without your magic. Will you follow me?~
@394  = ~Are you ready to die for me, spellslinger? You need to be strong and focused, if you wish to be of use.~
@395  = ~Our journey together draws to a close, yes. But before it truly ends, we must ensure that the man who brought you so much suffering, and my people - so much destruction, will harm nobody else. For you, for Evereska, for the Seldarine and the Weave, I shall stand by your side in this. Until your spirit returns.~
@396  = ~It may wait a little more, though this little may stretch into eternity, I suspect. But you are worthy of help, and Irenicus... Irenicus should be put to death. For you, for Evereska, for the Seldarine and the Weave, I shall stand by your side in this. Until your spirit returns.~
@397  = ~Without question. If there is anything I can do to shift the impossible odds, I will. Lead us, <CHARNAME>. I am surprising myself by saying this... but I believe in you.~
@398  = ~Yes, my autocratic leader, I shall follow you without hesitation. Is that what you wanted to hear? (sigh) Foolish <PRO_GIRLBOY>... but I understand your doubts. Rest assured, I will not leave your side until Irenicus lies dead.~
@399  = ~You! Hey, you! Elven fellow! Take off your coat!~
@400  = ~This is quite... unexpected. Are you sure you are talking to me?~
@401  = ~Who else? Think you can fool Missy? Take it off, and take it off NOW!~
@402  = ~Ah... I will have to decline, I fear. Dying in my robes would be preferable to being killed with nearly nothing on.~
@403  = ~Don't you walk away on me! I want your coat, and I WILL HAVE IT!!!~
@404  = ~I think not. Excuse me.~
@405  = ~You! Elven slug! Foul and sick to the core, all of you! How dare you walk boldly and openly amongst us!~
@406  = ~What do you suggest? That I jump from the Athkatlan Bridge, instead? I have an urge to throw you down there, to be honest.~
@407  = ~See this, people of Athkatla! He shows his murderous ways! Their race should be wiped clean from the face of Faerun, seared by the holy fire!~
@408  = ~I almost regret I have no fire spells available. Or do I? Regardless, <CHARNAME>, we'd better be away.~
@409  = ~Why, hello there, my little pointy-eared princess. Shall we be off to an evening of a gnomish passion, hm? I am sure you're wondering what my nose is all about.~
@410  = ~Not that I insist as of yet, but would you put your - rather large - nose out of other people's private life?~
@411  = ~Nobody asked your opinion, fellow. I was addressing that lovely elven lady over yonder.~
@412  = ~(sigh) Believe me, I have noticed.~
@413  = ~So, lovely, shall we scuttle away for a while? 'Tis a dangerous place at night, but I know of a quiet corner - ~
@414  = ~Continue addressing her in such a manner, and some of your body parts will be in danger indeed.~
@415  = ~Hmph. Suit yourself.~
@416  = ~(sigh) I tells ye, what I wouldn't give t' be able to just twiddle me fingers and conjure up some fish. The fishin's just been too bloody hard lately.~
@417  = ~Certainly. Years and years of study, a handful of accidents, spell components so sick-looking they deprive you of any appetite, a headache every morning, an obscene number of enemies, and you are a wizard - if you survive, that is.~
@418  = ~Stop it! Too bloody damn dangerous for me, anyway.~
@419  = ~(sigh) Truer words have never been spoken.~
@420  = ~All thieves should be hangin' from the gallows, I says. Nice and proper.~
@421  = ~That would be too harsh, I'm afraid. But if the law states so - ~
@422  = ~Ha, the law! Nobody listens to them lawyers, if ye ask me. Thieves have more power in this city than guards!~
@423  = ~Then there is your answer, madam. You cannot expect thieves to hang themselves, can you?~
@424  = ~(sigh) There be no justice in this world.~
@425  = ~But consider this: we shall all die, and in death, become as equal as can be.~
@426  = ~Ye calls that justice?~
@427  = ~The best there is.~
@428  = ~Aye, a nice sword ye has. Best use it well, with a murd'rer on the loose and all.~
@429  = ~With enemies like these, we are doomed, sword or no sword. But thank you for your words.~
@430  = ~'Allo, darling. Sure you wouldn't fancy joinin' me in me chambers for a bit of fun an' all that? The boys say I've hands that will melt away yer worries!~
@431  = ~Ah... tempting, I am sure. Another time, perhaps?~
@432  = ~Wow, you sure are sad. What gives?~
@433  = ~You will learn it soon enough, child. Life is hollow, and we are all going to die. More than enough to feel dejected, don't you think?~
@434  = ~MY MOTHER SAYS THAT ELVES SHOULD GO CLIMB A TREE SOMEWHERE!!~
@435  = ~A novel thought, I am sure.~
@436  = ~There once was an elf so upset
He'd lament to any who let.
He waited for death
With notable faith
But Fate let him down in the end.~
@437  = ~Did he become a wandering ghost, or did he die quicker than he could expect? Your blabbering prophesies nothing less dismal.~
@438  = ~Ah, sir, you were here to complain about a theft, yes? Unfortunately, it turned out that you filled some of the forms incorrectly, so - ~
@439  = ~(sigh) Never mind.~
@440  = ~You! I know you! This child, here, is yours!! It is time that you paid your dues for your foolish behavior!!~
@441  = ~Poor girl...~
@442  = ~Poor girl?! She is your daughter!~
@443  = ~The fact that she belongs to a different race does not count, I presume?~
@444  = ~(sigh) Here, have some coin, but I hope that it is the last I see of you.~
@445  = ~Much obliged, good sir. Lanie, thank your father.~
@446  = ~'nk you.~
@447  = ~(grumble)~
@448  = ~Say 'hello' to your father, dear... Blast it, it is you again! Move on, I have a job to do!~
@449  = ~My, aren't you gorgeous? (giggle) Come, sit with me.~
@450  = ~I tried this substance, once. Once was enough. Would that it were enough for everyone...~
@451  = ~I greet you, female, by the Dark Mother and the pleasure her children are entitled to. Here we breathe spices of luxury and enjoy the fruits of our conquests.~
@452  = ~Veldrin, if I could have your attention for a moment...~
@453  = ~You are free to do whatever you wish, especially now, when some overindulgence may help you survive. But I would rather... much rather... that you didn't. Please, think of me - of us - before approaching him again.~
@454  = ~I welcome you to the lust chambers, male. I do so adore the presence of new blood... especially in such a handsome form, and with such battle prowess, I hear.~
@455  = ~You come from Ched Nasad. I have heard that the Nasadrans are stuffy and conservative. I am intrigued to see if this matter is the truth or not.~
@456  = ~Come, male. I demand that you please me. I have fought long in the Society for Lolth's valor, and I am in need of a reprieve for a night.~
@457  = ~Though you are, ah, beautiful... I am not interested. Sorry.~
@458  = ~Mmmm, you are an elf, are you? Such a lithe body, and deft hands - girls like you, don't they?~
@459  = ~(sigh) You would be surprised...~
@460  = ~There be no decent livin' in this part of the city. Bloody fish and bloody sailors. Tsk.~
@461  = ~My condolences, madam.~
@462  = ~And thieves, too! Ah, if only there be more adventurers like you around!~
@463  = ~Ah, but we've no means to protect you, I'm afraid - ~
@464  = ~Protection? Ye cannot do anythin'! No, 'twas another thing I had in mind: when fancy folk like ye is robbed and killed, decent folk like us is left alone for some time.~
@465  = ~Thieves and taxes, taxes and thieves! You, in the robes - do you have anything to pay your taxes with?~
@466  = ~To be honest, no. Nor, I think, are Amnish officials eager to collect them off me.~
@467  = ~You adventurers are lucky folk, aren't you? I can't sleep at night, and you wander around without a worry.~
@468  = ~Oh, but you need not envy us: at least you will be alive long enough to pay them. We will likely die before the <DAYNIGHT> is out.~
@469  = ~Oho, mate! Have one with me! 'Tis a nice li'l life, and I've no damn wife...~
@470  = ~Drowning my sorrows in a bottle of wine? A tantalizing thought, but too strange a company. You should ask <CHARNAME>, though. I am sure <PRO_HESHE> wouldn't mind, given the way <PRO_HESHE> is surveying the bar at the moment.~
@471  = ~Such an entertaining place it would be, if not for this rabble floundering around.~
@472  = ~I suggest you take a walk to the docks. Some kind soul will certainly grant you the entertainment you desire.~
@473  = ~My father could throw you into prison if he wanted to! So there!~
@474  = ~Of course, child. We are trembling already. (sigh) At least, prison is a safe place.~
@475  = ~Oh, I say. Weren't you in the Council of Six Building a tenday before, lamenting the theft of some books and robes? Pathetic. Though I suppose I should thank you for some entertainment.~
@476  = ~Yes, it was me, and no, you are not welcome.~
@477  = ~Greetings, my lord. I am Madame Nin, and I am here to ensure you are pleasantly accompanied. Are you interested in companionship, my lord?~
@478  = ~Um... perhaps I had best be on my way. Please excuse me.~
@479  = ~So... do you wish a companion for the evening, then?~
@480  = ~Actually, no. Please excuse me.~
@481  = ~Er, no. I will be on my way.~
@482  = ~My sister was robbed blind, her house cleaned out while she slept. Mind you, her life has always been written in red ink.~
@483  = ~Alas, she was not the only one. Courtesy of some unknown mugger, I was robbed of everything but my spellbook and my sword.~
@484  = ~Aye, 'tis strange they never took it.~
@485  = ~I found it on the floor, with blood all over it. Sometimes wielding a moonblade instead of a plain sword has its advantages. In most cases, however, it is nothing but a curse.~
@486  = ~You! Have you ever been cheated, here? I bet ye have!~
@487  = ~I am cheated every single time. Cheated, robbed, imprisoned, forced to flee, to do battle, to fight at close quarters... Sometimes I think that I would rather lie down and die.~
@488  = ~Such an interesting sword you have. Could I hold it for a moment?~
@489  = ~That depends on how much you wish to die. If you touch the blade, you will badly singe your skin at the very least.~
@490  = ~Nonsense. Hmm... you have probably stolen it somewhere. A thief, eh?~
@491  = ~I have been called many things, but this... man, for lack of a better word, starts to test my patience. Shall we move on?~
@492  = ~You will go nowhere. Give me the sword, or I shall call the guards.~
@493  = ~<CHARNAME>, you saw me warning him, didn't you? Very well... here you go.~
@494  = ~Aaaaaaaaaaaaargh!~
@495  = ~'Aarrgh' indeed. Come, <CHARNAME>... this world is ever full of fools.~
@496  = ~Oh, do go away! Unless... You, the robed fellow, come closer. My dear mother collected coins, and there was an elven one with a profile not unlike yours. Now, I wonder - ~
@497  = ~If I am royalty or not. (sigh) Look at me, my good man. Do I look like one to you?~
@498  = ~Hmmm... no. No, definitely not. Away with you, peasant!~
@499  = ~I told you. I am fortunate that many years have passed; in my youth, they used to stop me in the streets every few days or so. My grandmother's elder brother had a remarkable profile indeed.~
@500  = ~So... you...~
@501  = ~Oh, do go away. (sigh)~
@502  = ~Pirates used t' fear Spellhold, you know... now they don't. And we used t' have a peaceful town, here. Would you believe it?~
@503  = ~I would believe, and I would help you, but we are powerless here. Your only hope is patience.~
@504  = ~Oh, somedays I am sure that the gods are all frowning on us. Faerun is doomed! Doomed!~
@505  = ~It is only a matter of time, my good <MANWOMAN>. Only a matter of time...~
@506  = ~I prayed to Lathander for prosperity, and now look at me! Worse than a beggar, I am!~
@507  = ~(sigh) A great disappointment indeed.~
@508  = ~A great disappointment? *You* are somebody's greatest disappointment! I am a respectable citizen, and I will NOT be robbed!~
@509  = ~It could be worse, you know.~
@510  = ~How? How could it be worse? Sweet Lathander, my life is destroyed!~
@511  = ~You have tomorrow, and the day after tomorrow. As for us, today is the last day of the rest of our lives.~
@512  = ~How do you know?~
@513  = ~Look at this <PRO_MANWOMAN>, good sir. Does <PRO_HISHER> life expectancy look like more than a day to you?~
@514  = ~Er.. I don't know...~
@515  = ~(sigh) Trust me, it is exactly a day. Or, more likely, an hour. Good day to you.~
@516  = ~Say, you are not a cleric of Kelemvor, are you? Only, you are so dark and gloomy in these robes of yours, I think you are.~
@517  = ~No, the Lord of the Dead is not my patron. Though he could be: at least, unlike this hellish mayhem, death is peaceful...~
@518  = ~Oh my, what a handsome boy you are! 'Tis a pity my good-for-nothing husband is home.~
@519  = ~A rare stroke of bad luck, I see.~
@520  = ~Aw, what a poor, underfed thing you are! You, <PRO_GIRLBOY> - make sure that your elf-boy eats well, or he's going to fall at the next tree. I've brought up five kids, I know how it is.~
@521  = ~Thank you, but I believe I'll manage on my own. Excuse me.~
@522  = ~Ye're all lazy scoundrellin' bastards. I slaved for years, and I got nuttin', and ye ain't doin' nuttin' but wrigglin' yer damn fingers, and ye're swimmin' in gold.~
@523  = ~Of course. In gold. As well as in sewage, slime, our own blood and other undesirable substances. Trust me, good man, you are better off than us.~
@524  = ~Ha! As if! Me wife is down with fever, our son died las' spring, and the landlady is goin' to throw us out tomorrow! Go on, ye freaks! I hope ye break yer damn neck soonish!~
@525  = ~You! You there! Are you a druid?~
@526  = ~No, madam, though I wish I was. Druids, at least, have a chance of survival among these bogs.~
@527  = ~I am so happy now that these genies are gone! Hey... Why the gloomy face? You have saved us all!~
@528  = ~Because we have nearly been killed by a mad rakshasa, a mad druid, and we are still going to be killed by a mad mage. Nothing changes, victory or not.~
@529  = ~You're an elf! We had lots of elves in the forest! They were real nice. You look nice, too, but why do you keep frowning and sighing? They did not behave like that!~
@530  = ~Does it matter, child? Play with your friends, while you can. We are going off to die... it is not something you would wish to learn about.~
@531  = ~You're just asking for trouble bringing that druid in here, and I don't want any part of it. I'll ask you nicely, now, to leave my inn peaceably before there's any damage.~
@532  = ~<CHARNAME>, may I?.. There is a certain spell...~
@533  = ~I'll have none of your druidic tricks here!~
@534  = ~These are not the druids you are looking for.~
@535  = ~What? What do you mean? And stop weaving your hands in front of me!~
@536  = ~(cough) I am out of practice, it seems. Let's try again.~
@537  = ~There is no druid in here.~
@538  = ~There is no druid in here... No druid? Wait, there he - ~
@539  = ~There is... no druid in here...~
@540  = ~You will give us a room.~
@541  = ~I will give you a room...~
@542  = ~Good.~
@543  = ~Yes, so... what can I do for you?~
@544  = ~The weather's foul and my feet hurt and I really don't feel like talking to strangers. Go away.~
@545  = ~Bravo. You managed to capture my whole life in a single sentence. Well done indeed.~
@546  = ~Don't look at me like that. I want to work here. In Trademeet, all employees are treated fairly... that's Waukeen's rule: fair trade. It's good coin for an independent woman, you know.~
@547  = ~Independent? How old are you?~
@548  = ~Twenty, m'lord.~
@549  = ~But you look much older than that. In human years... thirty, perhaps. Is this the kind of independence you want?~
@550  = ~Hmph. That was rude. No discount for you, then, sir. I'd go about my business, if I were you.~
@551  = ~You are a manner of mage, are you not, male? You should come to the Tower and join us rather than follow the beckonings of House Despana.~
@552  = ~My leader is seeking Lolth' favor by aiding this powerful House. Or do you presume to put your art above the Spider Queen's will?~
@553  = ~I... I meant no offfense, male. Please, proceed on your way.~
@554  = ~You are one of Veldrin's male companions? How interesting. Perhaps you shall be of service to me once my use of Veldrin is exhausted. Do not stray far.~
@555  = ~Ah... of course. At your command.~
@556  = ~(sob!) We are doomed! Umar has come and doomed us all!~
@557  = ~Ah, you have saved us, have you not? Thank you, thank you! Here, take some home cookies of mine: I've baked them only this morning. Must have known you were coming by!~
@558  = ~I do not know about you, <CHARNAME>, but I am tempted. May I?~
@559  = ~Of course! Ah, poor boy... oh, I am sorry, my lord. It's just... easy to tell you haven't eaten anything for a long, long time. Here, have them all.~
@560  = ~Are ye here to help us, then? Yon elf here does not look a sturdy fellow, if ye ask me. Better stay home an' let the real men do the work.~
@561  = ~(sigh) Believe me, I would love to. Though... wait. Do you consider yourself a man enough?~
@562  = ~Well... Johanna 'ere may say as much, aye?~
@563  = ~Then your place is out there, fighting evil and allowing weaklings like me to stay at home. Don't you agree?~
@564  = ~Er... I think I've urgent bus'ness elsewhere... aye, 'scuse me... now, where were 'em papers again...~
@565  = ~Returned, has ye? So, 'em shadows fled, and ye now deservin' reward, aye? Well... perhaps I was hasty. Perhaps ye were sturdier then I thought.~
@566  = ~Why, thank you. (sigh) If only our enemies were as reluctant in appraising our talents...~
@567  = ~Wow, a real wizard! Say, aren't ya afraid of Cowlies?~
@568  = ~(sigh) Say, are you a boy or a girl under this layer of grime? 'Cowlies' indeed... pray you never meet them, child.~
@569  = ~I saw them. In the Promenade, ya know? There was magic and stuff, and then the big guy - ~
@570  = ~Enough, boy... girl... boy. I am sure <CHARNAME> does not need to hear this yet *again*. Here, have a coin, and go play somewhere... else.~
@571  = ~Hey, you! Fella with a shiny sword!~
@572  = ~(sigh) Why me? Why always me?~
@573  = ~Yes, you! See this mighty fine sphere, here? You can have it for your very own for a mere 500 gold pieces! What do you say?~
@574  = ~You are not afraid that the true master of this device will come out and crush you like the miserable wretch you are, are you? I almost see it coming... the door behind you will open, and sad, sad music will start to play. But you will not hear it.~
@575  = ~Er... but the mage is dead, ain't he?~
@576  = ~You poor soul, don't you know? They come back. They always do.~
@577  = ~I guess... I guess I gotta keep an ear out, just in case. Ummm... goodbye, sir.~
@578  = ~Approach me once again, and you shall be flayed alive, commoner!~
@579  = ~Such fate awaits us all. Moonblade wielders, Moonfighters, Defenders of Elvendom... It is futile. (sigh) A hopeless world.~ [O#XAN000]
@580  = ~What? Why are you staring at me? Yes, I have finished my epitaph; we may go. Try not to step over his body as you take his blade, if you will.~
@581  = ~Oh.~ [O#XAN040]
@582  = ~You... you never do things halfway, do you?~
@583  = ~A Demilich... we killed a Demilich... I think I need to lie down for a while.~
@584  = ~<CHARNAME>. <CHARNAME>...~ [O#XAN000]
@585  = ~<CHARNAME>... we were meant to die. Imprisoned forever... and yet I am able to say your name. Your name - instead of millennia of misery.~
@586  = ~Perhaps... you know this, anyway, but I... wanted to tell you...~
@587  = ~(He shakes his head with a wry smile, leans in and kisses you on the cheek.)~
@588  = ~Not today.~
@589  = ~Perhaps we'll have a life together yet... who knows?~
@590  = ~(Xan swiftly crosses the distance between you and cradles your face in his palms, whispering hotly between kisses.)~ [O#XAN000]
@591  = ~Foolish... Reckless... Rash... Don't you EVER do this to me again...~
@592  = ~Never, do you understand me? If we encounter a Red Dragon ever again, I will drag you out of his lair kicking and screaming, if I have to.~
@593  = ~No. No, I won't. But please... do not battle dragons if you can help it, will you?~
@594  = ~(Xan rushes to your side and hugs you briefly and fiercely. His face is very pale.)~ [O#XAN000]
@595  = ~(Before you are able to react, he lets you go with a light whisper.) You are alive. Then all is well.~
@596  = ~<CHARNAME>... I am so sorry...~ [O#XAN000]
@597  = ~Bodhi WILL pay! Come, let's get her, while she's licking her wounds! We won't leave empty this time!~
@598  = ~Blast and damnation, not again! Not again...~ [O#XAN000]
@599  = ~No. No more platitudes, this time. Come, <CHARNAME>. I will not stand for more deaths.~
@600  = ~It is over. I expected this... but... fast, too fast... too abrupt.~ [O#XAN001]
@601  = ~You will be fine. We shall put you right in a moment.~
@602  = ~Xan... you... you are not dying on me, are you?~
@603  = ~I'll have Bodhi's head for what she has done!~
@604  = ~What happened? Why? I do not understand.~
@605  = ~You cannot, Estel'amin. The process is impossible to stop; I will die in a minute. Please... do not leave me. It is frightening... to pass away, never to return.~
@606  = ~Shhh... I will not. Here, hold my hand.~
@607  = ~You cannot die forever. We have strong magic at our disposal, and Elhan will help.~
@608  = ~Why, love? What happened to you at all?~
@609  = ~I am afraid I am. Selfish... isn't it? But better than eternal darkness... I am sorry, Estel'amin. Undeath is not for me, and my blade decided the same.~
@610  = ~You have nothing to apologize for. You made the right choice.~
@611  = ~It does not matter. The priests will revive you in a few hours.~
@612  = ~Did it... did your own blade kill you?~
@613  = ~Oh, you will. You will... will you leave me, then? I am a coward... but I do not want to die all alone; I am afraid.~
@614  = ~Shhh... I am here. Here, hold my hand.~
@615  = ~Death is but a moment of darkness. I will bring you back, love.~
@616  = ~But why do you have to die at all? What happened?~
@617  = ~My blade extinguished itself, saving me. Killing me, you might say... but Arvandor is far better than the cold limbo Bodhi wanted me to travel to. I can see the trees even now... they are beautiful. It is a pity you will never join me there... that we will never meet.~
@618  = ~Bodhi would not need a dying husk of a man... she left me in your hands, since in this state, I would not survive the transformation. I would die before she could turn me. But she may try to turn you... to harm you otherwise. Be prepared. Do not let my death... detain you.~
@619  = ~Very funny. I... I hope you will be happy in Arvandor, even without me.~
@620  = ~I swear, Xan, it is not forever. I will find a way to get rid of my divinity - and join you.~
@621  = ~I would have saved you. I would have done everything for you. And you decided to leave me, instead.~
@622  = ~I wish you never touched this thrice damned blade!~
@623  = ~Take me with you. Take me with you, to Arvandor...~
@624  = ~Goodbye.~
@625  = ~Impossible. It is not a spell or a piece of steel that is killing me - it is the Seldarine's will.~
@626  = ~Thank you. You are everything to me... and I am leaving you. 'Forever' is a cruel word, don't you think? But while we yet have a moment or two...~
@627  = ~I will not... but it does not matter. You do. Go.~
@628  = ~She who has hope has everything, doesn't she? It will never happen... but I will continue with this thought.~
@629  = ~It would have happened anyway. We lived on the edge; we should have been prepared to fall.~
@630  = ~Do you think it is so easy to separate the moonblade wielder and his duty? Foolish girl...~
@631  = ~I cannot. I wish I could...~
@632  = ~I love you.~
@633  = ~(Xan's dark eyes rest on you.)~ [O#XAN000]
@634  = ~(He approaches you quietly, and nips, very gently, at your ear and neck. Several small kisses later, you find yourself fully wrapped in his arms, face up and nose to nose with his. Judging by his half-closed eyes and content look, he is not going to let you out any time soon.)~
@635  = ~(He intently studies your pose and stature, eyes wandering lower and lower, until you start to feel undressed.)~
@636  = ~(Xan meets your eyes and shakes his head.)~
@637  = ~No, <CHARNAME>. I was simply thinking how much you reminded me of a certain image of Hanali. There was a statue of her in our garden... a nude statue, of course, and... oh. But never mind.~
@638  = ~(Xan yawns, looking perfectly nonchalant... then grabs your hand, and you never notice how exactly his lips manage to merge with yours.)~
@639  = ~(The kiss is swift, but lingering. Upon breaking up, Xan does not look half as sleepy: entranced, if anything.)~
@640  = ~(Xan stands behind you and slides his hands down your arms, his lips in your hair. The warmth of his skin is overwhelming, and as he takes your hands in his and places them on your chest, covering them with his own, you are starting to feel positively hot.)~
@641  = ~(He raises your hand to his lips. His fingers are warm and dry, and so are his lips: dry, hot and feverish. With a small shudder, he lets you go.)~
@642  = ~(Xan walks with a small sack of nuts in his hand, absent-mindedly crushing one nut after another, and just as absent-mindedly passing kernels to you.)~
@643  = ~(Soon, the sack is empty. Xan tosses it to his backpack and turns to you with a small, sad smile.)~
@644  = ~<CHARNAME>... you are the greatest squirrel in the world.~
@645  = ~(He gives you a small, knowing smile and takes your hand.)~
@646  = ~(He tucks a small flower behind your ear. You cannot see what it looks like, but its aroma is breathtaking. So breathtaking, in fact, that you feel as if you are about to sneeze, and with a toss of your head, you do it, sending the blossom flying... and stopping right in your cleavage.)~
@647  = ~(Xan stares at you, his mouth half-opened.)~
@648  = ~Yes... this is much better, I admit.~
@649  = ~(He does nothing, but continues to walk an arm's length from you, your feet and breath following the same calming rhythm for some time.)~
@650  = ~(Xan takes a small silken ribbon out of his pocket and twines it between your fingers, sliding it up and down until your skin starts to shiver with small electrical tingles.)~
@651  = ~(He tugs at the ribbon, which glides between your fingers with ease, and presses it to your hair. It immediately stands on end, but you feel his fingers guiding it, smoothing it, caressing it, molding it... and as he presents you with a raised eyebrow and a hand mirror, you witness the sublime, transient wonder your hair has become. For a long time, you stand transfixed, you staring into the mirror, and him - at you.)~
@652  = ~I wonder where our path will bring us to. Don't you?~
@653  = ~(Xan sighs and wraps his hands around your waist.)~
@654  = ~(Xan briefly puts his palms on your shoulders, somehow sending a warm, calming impulse both up and down your spine. It is pleasant at first, but then, a strange drowsiness envelops you.)~
@655  = ~(He hurriedly removes his hands.)~
@656  = ~It went further than I imagined... I am sorry. But now... now you need a remedy, do you not?~
@657  = ~(The long kiss that follows is neither decent nor quiet, but it definitely makes you feel awake.)~
@658  = ~(He presses his lips to your left temple, and drinks in the scent of your hair.)~
@659  = ~(Xan stops behind you and gently leans you back, until your head rests on his shoulder. Holding you by the waist, he whispers something in your ear, but you never hear him, as his closeness and scent overwhelm you.)~
@660  = ~(He continues to speak, then sighs, noticing your distracted look, and kisses you on the lips. It is one reliable way of getting your full attention...)~
@661  = ~(Despite the relative warmth of the setting, you feel feverish. Something deep inside of you is seeking a way out, making your blood freeze, and your body - double over with pain.)~
@662  = ~<CHARNAME>!~
@663  = ~(Xan falls on his knees before you and gathers you in his arms.)~
@664  = ~It is not an injury, is it? It is something within... How I wish I could shield you from this...~
@665  = ~(Xan drapes his cloak around your shoulders.)~
@666  = ~You were shivering again, or so it seemed. Perhaps I was wrong... but I would rather that you were inconvenienced by excessive care once than suffered from the lack of it constantly.~
@667  = ~(He is eyeing you with such intensity that it is impossible to be mistaken about his purpose. Caught, he meets your eyes with the same gaze - admiring, but not in the least bit guilty.)~
@668  = ~(He places a Rogue stone on your palm.)~
@669  = ~There is something I wish to show you...~
@670  = ~(You stare at the gem, and a different room materializes before you. Round and soft, decorated in the purest marble... and strangely familiar. The walls are covered in murals, one of them depicting a man so much like Xan that you feel your breath catching.)~
@671  = ~(You approach the window. Over an astounding variety of gardens, a crystal spire is challenging the sky, and below, past an arched bridge, a female statue stands with her hands outstretched, her ivory face bathing in sunlight.)~
@672  = ~(You stand if in a dream, but everything feels real: softness of the rug under your feet, running water in the next chamber, bright and vivid colors and furniture. But next moment, the vision blackens and crumbles, and you abruptly return to the here and now.)~
@673  = ~(Xan passes a hand over your palm, and you see that the stone is no more.)~
@674  = ~Evereska is far away. I could not take you there: a single portal will never be enough, and to some areas we simply cannot travel. But a glimpse of it, you now have.~
@675  = ~(Xan looks pensive, and you have a very nasty suspicion, why.)~
@676  = ~We go on, but your condition remains as hopeless as ever. A Bhaalspawn, a doomed Bhaalspawn... Why do we continue? Why...~
@677  = ~(He gives you a slow, pointed look.)~
@678  = ~<CHARNAME>, I have told you repeatedly: you are far too reckless. One day - ~
@679  = ~Ah, what is the point! You never listen.~
@680  = ~(Your cloak and garments are soaking wet after a recent rain, and Xan's are in no better condition. For some time, you continue, his occasional sneezes echoing yours, then he stops firmly.)~
@681  = ~We will die of common cold, if we continue like this. But I believe there is a way... stand still - ~
@682  = ~(His fingers suddenly spray with fire, which he cautiously brings inches away from your clothes. They dry remarkably well: within seconds, you are ready to admit that you have never felt as warm and comfortable as now.)~
@683  = ~(Xan is about to repeat the procedure on himself, when the fire blinks and goes out. He sighs and rolls his eyes.)~
@684  = ~Ever unfortunate, it seems. But if you feel better, then all is well. Come?~
@685  = ~More and more often, I find myself dreaming of kissing a face that I see everywhere. Perhaps you know who the lady in question might be? If you do, tell me - ~
@686  = ~(He suddenly breaks off and gives you a kiss. It is a fleeting one, but you can feel his lips hungry on yours.)~
@687  = ~Tell me... does she dream, too?~
@688  = ~(Xan walks up to you and pops a fresh strawberry in your mouth.)~
@689  = ~(sigh) I know, it will be just my bad luck that you do not like these...~
@690  = ~(He tentatively puts an arm around your shoulders and proceeds, clutching you at his side. After a minute or two, you break apart.)~
@691  = ~Thank you. I need to feel you close sometimes... often... always... but you know it well enough, don't you?~
@692  = ~(He places a small bottle in your lap.)~
@693  = ~Here. It will help you last a little longer. Not good enough for you, but then again, what is?~
@694  = ~Do you remember our days in Baldur's Gate? Or before, when we just met? No Irenicus, no Bhaal, no vampires, no thieves - only you.~
@695  = ~(wince) Oh, and a legion of your admirers, of course.~
@696  = ~How are you? You are not - ~
@697  = ~(He takes in your recent bruises and draws breath sharply.)~
@698  = ~Drink this. Now!~
@699  = ~<CHARNAME>, if we are to die...~
@700  = ~Then let us live what time we have in what measure of joy remains for the doomed.~
@701  = ~(He kisses you on the cheek, a long, soft and loving kiss.)~
@702  = ~Shall we start now?~
@703  = ~You are pale - not your nightmares again? Though your reveries are never peaceful.~
@704  = ~I often watched you in your rest back on the Sword Coast. Your breathing, the catch of air in your throat, the occasional murmur, your eyes fluttering in the night, looking beyond me and through me - you were so vulnerable...~
@705  = ~To think that one day, Bhaal will let your body be devoured, will let your beauty be diminished... I will protect you, if I can - and if I cannot.~
@706  = ~(cough) In addition to my regular injuries, I have caught a cold, it seems. Before long, you will be wheezing your way through one, as well. (cough) I am loathe to say this... but stay away from me for the time being... please. Will you?~
@707  = ~(He strokes your face, outlining your lips with his fingers, kisses your eyes once and the tip of your nose - at least three times, and then sighs, a sigh which plainly states: "Now I am ready to die.")~
@708  = ~(Xan takes a small thing out of the pocket of his robes. Crumpled and molten, it is still recognizable: an ordinary candle, the likes of which you may find at wayside inns all over the Sword Coast.)~
@709  = ~(He inclines his head at your questioning look.)~
@710  = ~Yes, <CHARNAME>. The very one.~
@711  = ~(Xan sighs and presses you close, so very close, in fact, that your bodies fully meet.)~
@712  = ~My <CHARNAME>... I was and I am one with you - what right had I to leave you?~
@713  = ~(His hands find their way around your waist and start stroking your back with light, reassuring touches. With his face so close to yours, though, this superficial massage is more a distraction than anything, and it ends as you expected it to end: with his hands in your hair and at the nape of your neck, and his lips locked with yours.)~
@714  = ~(Xan takes your hand in his, palm up, and traces small patterns along your knuckles, massaging slightly as his fingers walk. Within minutes, this simple touch sends your whole body tingling, but you find yourself unable to concentrate on why. Somehow, it does not bother you much.)~
@715  = ~(His eyes flash you an enigmatic smile.)~
@716  = ~I do have my small trade secrets, so to say.~
@717  = ~(sigh) And I will have to take them to the grave, it seems.~
@718  = ~(His left hand traces a long, firm line along your spine and stops at the small of your back. Then it goes up and down again, firmer, but slower and slower, until you feel your spine burning... but, strangely, your back is no longer sore.)~
@719  = ~(He kisses the back of your neck and quietly withdraws.)~
@720  = ~(His eyes follow the curves of your legs and hips, and, for a long moment, Xan does not raise his eyes.)~
@721  = ~(Then he does, very slowly, and you suddenly have a sharp suspicion that tonight, you will most definitely not be left alone.)~
@722  = ~(He runs his finger over the pointed tip of your ear. Then the fingertip slides lower, onto the curve of your neck, and a pair of soft lips takes its place. His movements are feather-light, but you find your body shivering and leaning back just the same.)~
@723  = ~(As he reluctantly withdraws, you hear a faint moan, but you are not sure who emitted it.)~
@724  = ~(Xan suddenly rushes to you. Startled, you instinctively jump aside, but trip over his leg and feel yourself falling forward. Reflexes kick in, and you catch hold of his robes, pulling him down with you.)~
@725  = ~(In the last moment, he yanks you from under him and lands on his back with a loud crash, bringing you on top. Both breathless, your hearts beating in a mad unison, you lie in silence for several moments, staring at each other in a daze.)~
@726  = ~I... am sorry, <CHARNAME>. I thought I saw a shadow... an assassin... (sigh) Let me help you up. One day, I will see a real danger, but by then, it will be far too late.~
@727  = ~(He takes your arms and gently pulls you in an embrace. For a moment you stand in silence, locked within each others' gaze. His body is cool and fragile in your arms, but his hands hold you with unexpected strength.)~
@728  = ~I...~
@729  = ~But you know, don't you?~
@730  = ~(His voice is much huskier than usual as he whispers into your ear.)~
@731  = ~You could say that you never meant it, but for me, your every move is a reminder, every word an invitation, every caress a tease, every action a promise. And speaking of actions... I do hope that you are prepared for the consequences.~
@732  = ~<CHARNAME>, should we fall... should I fall...~
@733  = ~(His eyes raise to hold yours as the last word leaves his lips. The rest is spoken in silence.)~
@734  = ~(Xan is twisting a long-stemmed yellow flower between his fingers. Noticing your attention, he gives you a weary smile.)~
@735  = ~Do you remember the wreath I made for you a year ago? Well, in a few minutes, you will have another.~
@736  = ~(Within a minute, his work is done. Instead of placing the wreath atop your head, however, he takes your hand and passes the yellow garland through your linked wrists. It dangles there precariously, but never slips however you sway, a living emblem of your lifetime bond. You continue in silence, your hand safely in his, and his thoughts, you are sure - of you.)~
@737  = ~Do you know how beautiful you are? I have seen you in silks, in your fighting garb and without it, but - ~
@738  = ~(A vision of your parting night in Baldur's Gate sharply and vividly stands before your eyes.)~
@739  = ~ - but without it all, you are unmatched.~
@740  = ~(He contemplates you thoughtfully for a moment, then produces a coin out of his robe pocket. Still pensive, but now with a tiny spark in his eyes, he flips it.)~
@741  = ~(The coin traces an elaborate curve in the air, and Xan closes his eyes, his lips moving soundlessly. He looks as if making a wish, and when the coin finally arrives, his dark eyes positively shine.)~
@742  = ~(He looks at the gold piece and tosses it away without a word.)~
@743  = ~As I expected...~
@744  = ~(His hands run down your sides with confidence and lock around your waist. Xan is about to kiss you, when something else attracts his attention. With an exasperated sigh, he drops his arms and prepares his fingers for casting. His eyes, however, linger on you.)~
@745  = ~(He casually loops an arm around your waist, a gesture you are long used to. With a start, you recall that a year ago, you walked side by side, little more than strangers, and such simple closeness was impossible.)~
@746  = ~(Xan notices your shiver and leans closer to you.)~
@747  = ~I am here, melamin. For as long as you wish me to be.~
@748  = ~Do you ever dream, <CHARNAME>? I know that you do, of power and destiny, but is there a single dream which burns your heart?~
@749  = ~I used to dream of High Magic long ago. My dream was of understanding and sacrifices, until I learned there was too much to understand, and sacrificing myself for the doomed nation was futile. Still, I bonded with my moonblade, and protecting my people became my other dream. Hopeless, but still a living, breathing dream.~
@750  = ~(He absently fumbles with your hair, brushing wayward wisps from your face.)~
@751  = ~But it fled, like dreams do. Fled, replaced by the thoughts of duty... and, later - a vision of your skin against mine, my lips upon yours. This one came true... but won't another emerge soon? When one has everything, the only thing left to desire is - nothing.~
@752  = ~(sigh) But I ramble again. Let us go.~
@753  = ~(Xan walks a few steps from you, all the time grumbling quietly. You start paying attention, and hear an Elven word or two you are familiar with - these are rather dirty and elaborate curses.)~
@754  = ~(Upon listening some more, you are sure that you can make out your captor's name and some unflattering epithets about the Shadow Thieves. Then it is the Cowled Wizards' turn and, finally, a long and humiliating oath concerning... himself. You must have gasped at this point, for Xan turns to you and smiles wryly.)~
@755  = ~I am not at my best today, I'm afraid. Every single person I can think of has only brought you pain, including myself. A failure and a traitor... perhaps it would have been better if we never met?~
@756  = ~(Xan reaches out and cradles your cheek in his palm. His eyes change immediately: you do not see this soft, childish expression often, but there it is, half-hidden by his long hair, but still visible, if only to you.)~
@757  = ~(He gives you a rare smile before resuming his place by your side.)~
@758  = ~(Xan eyes you in a very open manner for nearly a minute. Before turning away, he sighs, drinking in your presence, and sends you a hopeful look.)~
@759  = ~(His fingers run up the side of you neck, ending up curled around your left ear. For several long moments, they examine your tender spots, caressing, until your skin becomes extra-sensitive.)~
@760  = ~(Then, with slow, painful deliberation, he starts scratching you behind the ear. His movements are light, delicate and never firm, and your instincts come to life immediately. Your eyes half-close, your back arches, and you fall into his embrace, a fall which he easily prevents, wrapping a free arm around your hips. You rest on his shoulder for a while before moving on, with his lips softly exploring the other side of your face... including your other ear.)~
@761  = ~(His fingertips dart out to explore your visage, but stop inches away from your face. Xan drops his hands and stares at your left eyebrow, very pale.)~
@762  = ~If this is an another scar... who dared...~
@763  = ~(sigh) Ah, just a smudge. Here... it is gone. Oh, <CHARNAME>... you scare me sometimes.~
@764  = ~(Noticing your attention, he gives you a questioning stare.)~
@765  = ~Mmm... did you just say something?~
@766  = ~(sigh) No, of course not. I am hearing things, it seems.~
@767  = ~You are a curse. This vision of you without... ah, never mind this... occupies all my time. You do not wish me to research my spells with this image in my mind, I assure you. A horde of drooling orcs is not a pleasant sight.~
@768  = ~(Xan reaches for your hand and tentatively slips his fingers between yours, exploring your skin from the wrist to the tips of your fingers. Apparently unsatisfied with what he finds, he looks at you with a frown.)~
@769  = ~I would that you kept out of battle. If only...~
@770  = ~(Xan silently presses his fingertips to his lips, and then to your cheek. A strange sensation lingers there, warm and stinging at the same time.)~
@771  = ~The night is ours... It has been a long time, but I still cannot take it for granted.~
@772  = ~(Xan gently kisses your forehead.)~
@773  = ~I pray I never will.~
@774  = ~(He gives you a small, clearly forced smile.)~
@775  = ~I am afraid, <CHARNAME>. Every man carries his doom within, but my own is far too close. My beautiful, unavoidable, and inescapable doom. You.~
@776  = ~You are so beautiful... so alive. Are you truly meant to die forever in a matter of months?~
@777  = ~I will never believe it. Never.~
@778  = ~<CHARNAME>, what will lingering in Athkatla give you, except for more enemies? Imoen is long dead, but Irenicus lives. Until you face him, you will never feel safe. If you stay, he will face you on *his* terms, and, believe me, you will not like it.~
@779  = ~Melamin, we must take this step. While Bodhi lives, the way to Suldanessellar and your soul is shut. We must open it, or all is lost.~
@780  = ~Think on it... please. I, on my side, will try not to overwhelm you with my... attentions... in the future. You have enough on your mind as it is.~
@781  = ~(It seems that Xan's attention is focused on you again.)~ [O#XAN000]
@782  = ~(Noticing your gaze, he quickly turns away.)~
@783  = ~(He has this dreamy expression of his again, and looks as if he is about to kiss his own hand. He blinks and hastily drops it.)~
@784  = ~(You catch a longing, lingering look directed at you.)~
@785  = ~(As if accidentally, he briefly touches your hand.)~
@786  = ~(His fingers tap-dance across your shoulders, as if playing a melody. To your surprise, you feel your skin responding, and a moment later, you even hear faint, pleasant music. It vanishes the moment he withdraws his hands.)~
@787  = ~(His hand sneaks under your sleeve and briefly presses your wrist. Pleasant coolness lingers on your skin - a sensation that is not soon gone.)~
@788  = ~(His mouth suddenly unpurses into a magnificent smile.)~
@789  = ~I found you again... Seldarine, I barely believe it.~
@790  = ~(With a doubtful expression, Xan takes your hand in his.)~
@791  = ~(A star burns with an impossible shine between his fingers. On closer examination, it proves to be his blade's pommel gem.)~
@792  = ~(Xan notices your interest and carefully covers the blade's scabbard. Then he raises his face, and in his eyes two smaller stars gleam briefly with mirrored light.)~
@793  = ~(Xan looks around in alarm, then sees you and sighs.)~
@794  = ~Thank the Seldarine for that. I lost sight of you, and I thought... it was impossible.~
@795  = ~(Xan gives you a worryingly fond look.)~
@796  = ~(Xan suddenly waves a hand, mutters a word, and you watch, mesmerized, as the air in front of you tightens, condenses, and your perfect reflection comes alive from the fine mist.)~
@797  = ~(Unbidden, Xan walks through it, his arms outstretched, and the image shatters.)~
@798  = ~(He looks at you with an ironic smile.)~
@799  = ~There is only one of you.~
@800  = ~(He squeezes your hand painfully.)~
@801  = ~Yesterday, I dreamt of dust dissolving in the wind - again. Be careful... for me... will you?~
@802  = ~(He bites his lip, seemingly mulling on what he is about to say.)~
@803  = ~You know, my fondest hope for over a year was to kiss you in the plain view of everyone who might enjoy the performance.~
@804  = ~(He gently kisses you on the cheek.)~
@805  = ~If only all my dreams could be fulfilled this easily...~
@806  = ~(His hands run over your back and shoulders, brushing the road dust from your garments. He is quick to use it as an excuse, and catches you in an embrace before withdrawing.)~
@807  = ~(Xan touches the tips of your fingers with his, slowly interlacing them, until his hand is buried in your palm. All the time, he looks as serious and thoughtful as if he was researching a particularly difficult spell.)~
@808  = ~(Xan lets out a deep, heartbreaking sigh and pointedly stares at your surroundings, your bedrolls, firmly tied to your backpacks, and then at you.)~
@809  = ~We are to rest soon, are we not?~
@810  = ~(Cautiously, Xan makes two small steps towards you and proceeds by your side.)~
@811  = ~(Thinking himself covered from view, Xan quietly admires your hair.)~
@812  = ~(He idly twirls a white flower in his hands. On closer examination, the blossom is exotic and fragrant, if slightly rumpled.)~
@813  = ~(Xan notices your attention and gives you a hopeful look. Something in your face discourages him, however, for the next moment, he crumples the hapless flower and swiftly walks away.)~
@814  = ~(He glances at you, at your surroundings, then at you again, and at last speaks.)~
@815  = ~Both here and on the Sword Coast, you are swimming in attention, admired... loved. Why would you need my company at all?~
@816  = ~(Xan hesitantly, almost shyly, reaches out and strokes your cheek.)~
@817  = ~(He tenses, examining a small scar just below your ear, and for a moment, his eyes become bottomless black.)~
@818  = ~It was Irenicus, was it not? <CHARNAME>...~
@819  = ~<CHARNAME>, I think that you dropped this...~
@820  = ~(He presses a small piece of parchment in your hand. A completely ordinary one, except that it has a very recognizable profile sketched on it. Yours.)~
@821  = ~(He wraps his hands around your shoulders and whispers in your ear.)~
@822  = ~<CHARNAME>, do my misfortunate heart a favor and tell me that you do not - ~
@823  = ~No. Don't. Let hope die last.~
@824  = ~The world is slowly dying. Will we survive?~
@825  = ~'We'... (sigh) Madness.~
@826  = ~(Xan gently, gingerly takes your hand and kisses it.)~
@827  = ~(He stares at you, and you notice an unbecoming line between his eyebrows, a line that won't go away.)~
@828  = ~(Xan glares at you with suspicion.)~
@829  = ~I am not going to wither with old age just yet, in case you are wondering.~
@830  = ~Do you believe in what we do? You are so passionate at times... but you do not understand it at all. You do not understand that you may die any moment... that no one will ever see your face again...~
@831  = ~(He turns away abruptly.)~
@832  = ~(He walks too closely behind you, and his soft, hot breath momentarily singes your skin. You give an involuntary shudder, and Xan hastily retreats to his usual position in line.)~
@833  = ~(Without any preamble, he draws you close and buries his face in your hair.)~
@834  = ~You are hurt so often... so much... Never again, if I can help it.~
@835  = ~(He draws back and gives you a wry smile.)~
@836  = ~But I cannot.~
@837  = ~(He reaches out for your hand, and you catch his scent: dry grass and running water.)~
@838  = ~(Xan notices your attention and half-opens his mouth, his eyes firmly fixed on your face. He stares at you for a long moment, and then, seemingly unable to resist, kisses the tip of your nose.)~
@839  = ~(You catch a very vulnerable look in his eyes... but he sharply passes a hand over his face, and it becomes a dark, gloomy mask again.)~
@840  = ~<CHARNAME>, you - you constantly stare at me, when I need to concentrate! We will die if I do not!~
@841  = ~(He turns on his heel and walks away in a huff, but you manage to catch: "...though, if I die, why should she care...")~
@842  = ~(He idly twirls a loose ring on your finger, forgetting himself so completely that eventually it slips into his palm. He is about to walk away with it, then slaps his forehead and slowly, gingerly establishes it on your hand again.)~
@843  = ~(His eyes totally blank and his mouth slightly open, Xan is lost in daydreaming reverie.)~
@844  = ~(He abruptly shakes himself awake when he is about to stumble, and his eyes immediately fly to you. A not-so-subtle hint as to who the subject of his dreams has been...)~
@845  = ~(Seeing you unconsciously licking your dry lips, he swiftly reaches for his water flask. Alas, it is screwed only loosely... and as he sharply pries it from its nest, your face and shoulders are generously splashed with cold water.)~
@846  = ~(Xan gasps in horror and hurriedly starts to wipe the drops from your neck, cheeks and garments... using any means available, so you end up tangled in each other, his lips on your cheek, and his fingers in the hollow of your throat. Contrary to the previous hassle, Xan is in no hurry to step back this time.)~
@847  = ~(Xan is deep in studying a scroll. At last, his face lights up, and he raises his eyes, never ceasing the soundless recital. A moment later, a shapeless pattern between his fingers weaves into a spell. Noticing it, Xan tries to shake it off, but it is too late. A beam of golden dust makes its way towards your head.)~
@848  = ~(The last thing you see is Xan's look of horror, dissolving into darkness.)~
@849  = ~(You come to your senses on the same spot, with the sole difference that now your every thought is accompanied by dull headache. Xan stands next to you, his spellbook open on the page featuring dispelling enchantments.)~
@850  = ~I... accidentally... - yes, accidentally, do not look at me like this! - cast a charm spell on you, so you were... ah... in my power for several seconds. (sigh) I found nothing better than to spend this time searching for a counter-spell.~
@851  = ~(His gaze lingers on your lips, then slips down your neck and into your cleavage, its force intensifying with every second. When the sensation becomes almost physical, he drops his eyes... but several minutes later, you catch him looking again, this time more cautiously.)~
@852  = ~(You catch a light whisper.)~
@853  = ~She embodies beauty, imagination and craft. She is associated with the color amethyst, the season of autumn, and the element of wind. She is life, and she is destruction...~
@854  = ~(He turns to you, eyebrows raised.)~
@855  = ~Haven't you heard this human legend? It is half-forgotten now, but as you grew up at Candlekeep...~
@856  = ~In ancient times, long before the fall of Myth Drannor, there was a woman with many talents; even her name meant "all-gifted". Some say her purpose was to inspire beauty; some - to pierce hearts, and some - to unleash destruction upon Toril. The latter, of course, were correct.~
@857  = ~She had a jar, a gift from Ao himself, which she was to keep shut at all times. Great evil was contained within, as it often is, in legends. However, she was only a human - and being only a human, and a woman, at that, she was curious. She eventually opened the lid, and destruction spread over kingdoms and nations at once. She tried to seal the jar, but it was too late. Only one thing remained imprisoned in her hands, and that was Hope.~
@858  = ~You remind me of her sometimes. It is only a legend, but... who knows?~
@859  = ~(A large red apple drops in your palm.)~
@860  = ~(If you did not know him well, you could say that the look in Xan's eyes is one of mischief.)~
@861  = ~(Xan glances at the traces of your recent injuries and bites his lip.)~
@862  = ~(He says nothing, and you already consider the incident a thing of the past, when he slips something small and weightless into your pocket.)~
@863  = ~(Wordlessly, he gathers you into his embrace and just as quickly lets go.)~
@864  = ~...bright her beauty, and quick her downfall. (sigh) <CHARNAME>, if you do not stop picking fights over every little thing, we all shall die. How many times should I tell you this?~
@865  = ~(He mutters a quick apology and resumes his place in formation, but you have already seen just WHERE exactly he was looking.)~
@866  = ~(Xan walks by your side with a calm, detached look. In fact, you have never seen your legs observed as casually... and unblinkingly.)~
@867  = ~(Xan leans over you, peering into the map over your shoulder. His hair tickles your cheek, his fingers stroke your arm, you feel him drawing aside your hair as if to kiss you on the back of your neck... but he suddenly comes to his senses, and steps back with a formal bow.)~
@868  = ~(Xan regards you with a frown.)~
@869  = ~You always stash jewelry somewhere, and wear plain runes instead of rings and necklaces. But... perhaps, some day, you will change this custom?~
@870  = ~(He slips something cool and light around your neck.)~
@871  = ~Starting now...~
@872  = ~(Xan casts an irritated glance at your surroundings, but then his gaze falls on you, and his face visibly softens.)~
@873  = ~You deserve so much more...~
@874  = ~(Tired and dejected, Xan barely pays attention to where he is going. His arms dangle helplessly at his sides, and his walk is a weary stagger.)~
@875  = ~(He looks at you and suddenly smiles - an odd, rare, but surprisingly becoming performance.)~
@876  = ~You will survive. For you, if not for myself.~
@877  = ~(Xan slides your pack down your shoulders, running his palms over your sweaty back. Then he snaps his fingers, and pale light envelops his lean form. It is obviously some sort of a strength enhancement spell, for he slings your pack over his shoulders with ridiculous ease.)~
@878  = ~(For nearly half an hour, you walk free of your burden, feeling your arms and shoulders respond with grateful and slightly guilty pleasure.)~
@879  = ~(There is so much conflict in his eyes that you cannot really say whether it is wariness, fondness or sadness that you see.)~
@880  = ~(Seeing you look back, Xan flushes and carefully avoids eye contact with you.)~
@881  = ~(Caught in the act, Xan winces and mouths something about the weather.)~
@882  = ~(Xan takes a deep, shuddering breath and opens his mouth to speak, but ends up whispering some total nonsense into your ear, touching it once or twice with his lips. You suspect that it was his goal all along...)~
@883  = ~(Xan opens his mouth and runs his hand through his hair, seemingly lost for words. He finds only one, resorting to his native tongue in confusion.)~
@884  = ~Irmoamin...~
@885  = ~(He suddenly frowns.)~
@886  = ~You do not understand High Elven, do you?~
@887  = ~(Xan studies you with his usual blend of moroseness and curiosity, until a small sound, half a groan, half a growl, escapes his lips. He hastily clamps a hand over his mouth.)~
@888  = ~(After what seems a thousandth look at your profile, Xan sighs and firmly closes his eyes. He cannot help his faint, dreamy smile, however, and it slowly establishes itself again, making him look childish and adorable.)~
@889  = ~(He blinks twice, thrice, and, with an obvious effort, returns to his gloomy and unreadable self.)~
@890  = ~(You catch a whiff of garlic, meat and smoke, and your mouth starts to water.)~
@891  = ~(Xan notices this and draws you close with a loud sigh.)~
@892  = ~My poor <CHARNAME>. We will not be able to stop for a meal any time soon, I fear. But this may help you a little.~
@893  = ~(He places a small lump of bread and cheese on your palm.)~
@894  = ~(His toe traces patterns in the dust, his face thoughtful.)~
@895  = ~(When you approach, you see that he repeats a single pattern - an elven rune representing Corellon. Before you are able to say anything, Xan raises his eyes, sighs and takes your hands in his.)~
@896  = ~I was seeking help from the divine... but I am beyond help, it seems.~
@897  = ~(You feel small beads of sweat forming on your forehead. Xan notices it, too, and looks at you with concern. He is hesitant for almost a minute; then he decisively wraps an arm around your shoulders.)~
@898  = ~<CHARNAME>, you obviously do not get enough rest. These pathetic eight hours after the day-long marches are of no use. We have little time to waste, but anything is better than driving yourself into the grave. Please, let yourself rest.~
@899  = ~No. We are in Hell, and I am as frightened as you are. This is not the time for the small talk.~ [O#XAN000]
@900  = ~You were ready to kill me moments before. Do you think I am eager to discuss it? Best think again.~ [O#XAN000]
@901  = ~What? Do you want us to be killed here and now because of your sudden desire for verbal exchange? Excuse me, but I do not.~ [O#XAN000]
@902  = ~(A drow Xan looks as surly as an elf Xan.)~ [O#XAN000]
@903  = ~Hey, relax! We'll get through, I know!~
@904  = ~How do you like your new looks?~
@905  = ~Fancy a walk to the lust chambers?~
@906  = ~What do you think of dark matriarchies?~
@907  = ~Drow ways are just horrible!~
@908  = ~I am so scared...~
@909  = ~Ust Natha is my dream come true!~
@910  = ~I miss the sun, I want out, I want to be myself again!~
@911  = ~So, ready to kneel before every drow female we meet?~
@912  = ~Male, fetch me something to eat!~
@913  = ~Xan, I need you. Now, more than ever.~
@914  = ~Hold me, please...~
@915  = ~It is all your fault that we are here! You should have protected me!~
@916  = ~Why don't we partake of some drow pleasures, while we are here? Only you and I...~
@917  = ~(Say nothing)~
@918  = ~No, we shall not. (sigh) My life has been a litany of failure, dashed expectations, and unfulfilled dreams, but at least it is almost over.~
@919  = ~Really? Look around. All signs point to DEATH.~
@920  = ~And the sad thing is that we'll see it coming.~
@921  = ~No. All exits are closed to us. Every road leads only to despair, every door hides sorrow and loss, and every face houses a hatred for the very essence of what makes you you - an offspring of Bhaal. Leave me be.~
@922  = ~No, <CHARNAME>. Death, you'll find, is unobliging.~
@923  = ~Do you truly believe it?~
@924  = ~(groan)~
@925  = ~I feel sick, and my current looks do not make me feel any better.~
@926  = ~Disgusting. And how, may I ask, do you like yours?~
@927  = ~Alluring.~
@928  = ~Handsome.~
@929  = ~Beautiful.~
@930  = ~Repulsive.~
@931  = ~Ugly.~
@932  = ~Weird.~
@933  = ~I don't care.~
@934  = ~(sigh) I should have known.~
@935  = ~To say the least.~
@936  = ~Why did you ask me, then? To torment me further? (sigh) Leave me be.~
@937  = ~Were it not for your desperate state, I would have never agreed to this... illusion. Do not remind me of it.~
@938  = ~I have never felt worse in my entire life, and you know it.~
@939  = ~Thank you, but no. Drow women are not to my taste at all, let alone men. (shudder)~
@940  = ~Are you so eager for tentacle rods? We are being watched, and our time is limited.~
@941  = ~(snort) Oh, yes. Drow society can tolerate any form of sexual behavior, as long as you don't disturb the spiders in the streets, and stab your lover in the back afterwards.~
@942  = ~Except, perhaps, for a liaison with a non-drow. But then again, as long as the slave is fed to the spiders, who is truly going to care?~
@943  = ~(sigh) Your desires are disastrous.~
@944  = ~If you are so eager to be used, I cannot stop you. Do not expect drow to be gentle lovers, however.~
@945  = ~I do not know of many. Elven society does not pay much attention to gender... age and parentage, mainly. But if you are asking my opinion of the Drow society, it is clear: despicable.~
@946  = ~In theory, it is pleasing to know that I will never concern myself with making decisions. In practice, I do not see it working. Unless you know of an example?~
@947  = ~Oh, what is the point in it, really? Every society is doomed, and a deviation from the norm doubly so. Just look at Ust Natha and its rulers.~
@948  = ~I do not care to discuss it.~
@949  = ~We are in the Underdark, <CHARNAME>. One of these societies is in front of you. I believe you are able to form an opinion, are you not?~
@950  = ~Indeed, but keep your rage in check. If we are caught, we are doomed. Yes, I know, we are doomed regardless of what we do, but it is nice to pretend that we have a chance, is it not?~
@951  = ~(sigh) I see that you want to kill them all, but you hesitate. And then, you will pick exactly the wrong moment to stop hesitating. Do not do this.~
@952  = ~<CHARNAME>, stop fuming. They will pay, in a metaphorical sense, but if you interfere, you will pay in a literal one.~
@953  = ~(shrug) Consider a violent solution. Though I wouldn't.~
@954  = ~Indeed, but what can you do about it? Nothing.~
@955  = ~Darkness is coming... and after that, more darkness. I am sorry, <CHARNAME>, I cannot help you.~
@956  = ~And right you are. We are doomed, and vigilance won't help. It is over.~
@957  = ~You're showing good levels of dread, but you're dreading all the wrong things.~
@958  = ~(sigh) Your fears are entirely justified. And then some.~
@959  = ~You are not alone in this. Take it as a consolation of sorts.~
@960  = ~And my nightmare...~
@961  = ~(sigh) You will change, but you will never learn.~
@962  = ~This city will kill you. Or, if it does not, it can still leave you flayed, maimed, beaten and bleeding in the gutter. Would you want that?~
@963  = ~You are losing your head. Are you expecting a handsome drow of an opposite gender to give their heart to you? Well, they will. You will soon meet a tall, dark, handsome stranger with blazingly white hair who will rip off your head.~
@964  = ~I truly do not wish to know what your other dreams are...~
@965  = ~So do I. It is unbearable.~
@966  = ~It will not come to be. We shall all die here.~
@967  = ~Soon, <CHARNAME>. If at all...~
@968  = ~A tenday, another, and I will break down. I feel it in my bones. Underdark was bad enough, but this form?~
@969  = ~And it is worse for you, is it? (sigh) I do not know how you are able to stand it all.~
@970  = ~We have a chance, if a small one. Take heart in this.~
@971  = ~Wait. Me, comforting you? I must say, this place influences me quite a lot.~
@972  = ~Do I have another choice? Do you?~
@973  = ~I will. Tentacle rods and spider pits are not to my liking.~
@974  = ~No, I will stand proud and strong and kill them all with my mighty magic! <CHARNAME>, why do you keep asking the obvious things? Yes, I will kneel and bend, and so will you, if necessary. I do not see what else we can do in this hopeless place.~

@980  = ~You will have my ration, if you insist, but there is no need for such tone.~
@981  = ~I hope that you have no plans of staying here and becoming a Matron Mother, do you?~
@982  = ~(groan) I am truly doomed, it seems.~
@983  = ~I am sorry, <CHARNAME>, but I cannot. What we had is gone.~
@984  = ~You are <CHARNAME>, spawn of Bhaal. I am a mortal man, whom you nearly killed. Let us not talk of this further.~
@985  = ~It is over, <CHARNAME>. There is no point in picking at old wounds... or pouring salt into them, for that matter.~
@986  = ~I will ask for your forgiveness again and again, if I have to, but I cannot be with you, <CHARNAME>. Forgive me.~
@987  = ~I would sell my soul to help you, if I could. But I cannot give you what you're asking for.~
@988  = ~What for? Do you need my strength? Then let me disappoint you: I have none. None whatsoever.~
@989  = ~You know you have me. But not here, <CHARNAME>. Not now.~
@990  = ~It is dangerous to show affection in the Underdark, and you should know. Later, <CHARNAME>. If there is later.~
@991  = ~We should concentrate on the task at hand. I am sorry.~
@992  = ~So do I, but the circumstances are against us, I fear.~
@993  = ~We are watched, <CHARNAME>. I cannot.~
@994  = ~(He takes you in his arms, and for a very brief moment, Underdark vanishes. You sense a faint, fresh smell of flowers and hear the roar of a distant sea; if you raise your head, it seems, you will feel the sunlight. It is warm and calm... but Xan steps back, and the shelter vanishes.)~
@995  = ~Beautiful... have patience. If things go well, we will not endure this illusion for long, but if we show who we are now, our stay in this form will be short indeed.~
@996  = ~(For a moment, you are unsure whether these dark hands, holding you, truly belong to Xan, but then a familiar voice whispers in Elven in your ear, and your doubt vanishes.)~
@997  = ~(He briefly presses his face to your cheek before letting you go.)~
@998  = ~(As you step up to Xan, he closes his eyes. His face calms, and you could swear he almost smiled a moment ago... at an image of the old you, it seems.)~
@999  = ~(He shakes his head and opens his eyes. When you meet his gaze, he tries to smile, but it is a forced, pained grimace. He does not look at you again.)~
@1000 = ~(The embrace feels awkward, uncomfortable. Xan lets you go within a few seconds.)~
@1001 = ~(Xan places your hands on his shoulders, pulling you close. His body stays tense, however, and when you lay your head on his shoulder, you hear his heart beating way too fast.)~
@1002 = ~(He lets you go without a further word.)~
@1003 = ~(Xan raises an eyebrow, but holds you firmly in return. His fingers travel across your back, stroking your hair from time to time, and you hear no sighs, which is surprising in itself.)~
@1004 = ~(He seems reluctant to let you go.)~
@1005 = ~(With a sigh, Xan embraces you, and a curtain of grayish-white hair falls on your face, mingling with your own hair.)~
@1006 = ~(Half-hidden from the sight of others, you share a very long kiss...)~
@1007 = ~(Xan buries his face in your hair and holds you tighter, until you are almost unable to breathe.)~
@1008 = ~I was not there to catch you, when you fell... I am sorry.~
@1009 = ~I should have, and I could not. But if you meant 'dying for me', not 'protecting me', then not all is lost. I will die for you any moment - say the word.~
@1010 = ~Oh, of course. Irenicus has nothing to do with it. It was me all along.~
@1011 = ~I tried, <CHARNAME>. I tried... but there was no antidote to the herb Irenicus used. Your spirit was whisked away, and I could do nothing.~
@1012 = ~(Xan ignores your outburst entirely.)~

@1014 = ~This form holds no attraction, how many times do I have to tell you? No!~
@1015 = ~But I need you... I really do. Please, do not deny me this.~
@1016 = ~Silence, male! I demand that you show me your skills.~
@1017 = ~The darkness will hide our faces. Come, I'll show you.~
@1018 = ~Fine!~
@1019 = ~The rare and exquisite purity of your longing counts for absolutely nothing. Your life does. My sanity does. <CHARNAME>, my head is spinning, I see an illusion in your place and an abomination in mine. Take pity on me, if you will.~

@1021 = ~Lolth knows no pity, and neither do I. Follow me, male!~
@1022 = ~I will. I am sorry, Xan. I will leave you alone for now.~
@1023 = ~Oh, it's like that, is it? Very well, 'Mistress Veldrin'. At your command... but I cannot promise you will like it.~
@1024 = ~They say the heart has reasons which reason does not know, but your heart in particular defies understanding. Very well, <CHARNAME>. If you insist, you will be treated to some... exotic arts tonight. (sigh) Why are you so keen on insisting?~

@1026 = ~I have nothing to say to you. Nothing whatsoever. Why do you keep bothering me?~ [O#XAN000]

@1031 = ~We are going to the mouth of death herself. What is the point in getting acquainted, I ask you? Do leave me be.~ [O#XAN000]
@1032 = ~What? Do you want another forecast of our gloomy fate? Inevitable dismemberment, being flayed alive, hanged or worse? If you wish gory detail, you will find it soon enough. Just follow <CHARNAME>.~ [O#XAN000]
@1033 = ~Death. We shall die, and be forgotten. But at least we won't remember.~ [O#XAN000]
@1034 = ~Our time is precious and short. Why you would want to waste it is beyond me.~ [O#XAN000]

@1036 = ~(Xan turns to you, frowning.)~ [O#XAN000]
@1037 = ~How are you?~
@1038 = ~Fancy a drink?~
@1039 = ~Do you trust me?~
@1040 = ~Hey, stop scowling!~

@1042 = ~What are you thinking of?~
@1043 = ~We're all doomed, you know.~
@1044 = ~Do you have any advice for me?~
@1045 = ~I am so tired of this dirt and muck!~
@1046 = ~What do you think of my heritage?~
@1047 = ~Is there something you wish to say?~
@1048 = ~May I ask you a question?~
@1049 = ~May I talk to you?~
@1050 = ~Look at me! How do you think I should feel?~
@1051 = ~Unwell. Sick, tired and distinctly desiring rest.~
@1052 = ~Ready to bid the world farewell, I believe.~
@1053 = ~Empty. No one to mourn me, no real accomplishments, and stuck in a company of the Bhaalspawn, at that. I do not even have the heart to mourn myself.~
@1054 = ~Me? I am preparing for our next inevitable defeat, naturally.~
@1055 = ~I feel as if I am about to die. These dungeon crawls have not improved my health at all.~
@1056 = ~We are doomed, we are doomed, we are doomed - ~
@1057 = ~What? What have you just asked?~
@1058 = ~Oh, I am fine. Apart from the fact that half of Amn is after us, I feel very good indeed.~
@1059 = ~I am trying to hold on... but it is difficult.~
@1060 = ~Not at all bad, but it could be better. But it always could be, could it not?~
@1061 = ~No, thank you.~
@1062 = ~I do not think my drunken self will be of much help to you, now, will it?~
@1063 = ~Well, if we are talking of a single drink here - ~
@1064 = ~Why, it is good. Very good. An-nother one?~
@1065 = ~Say, why does it take us soooo long to get rid of this cheap conjurer, Ir-renicus? Leave him to me, I say, and he will bite (hic!) the d-dust in an hour!~
@1066 = ~Not after what happened the last time, no.~
@1067 = ~I have enough in my flask for the moment, but thank you for your kind offer.~
@1068 = ~Oh, thank you.~
@1069 = ~I m-must say - ~
@1070 = ~To the Nine Hells with vampires, thieves and mages! Let us f-forget 'em all and live forever! We are NOT doomed!~
@1071 = ~<CHARNAME>, your constant attempts to get me drunk are rather tiresome.~
@1072 = ~We have a long and dangerous road ahead of us. I prefer to face death sober.~
@1073 = ~Why, haven't you emptied your flask yet? I thought you would.~
@1074 = ~Oh, no. You wish to see me senselessly drunk, or worse, you will find some unfortunate girl to keep me company. Leave me out of this.~
@1075 = ~I...~
@1076 = ~I do not know.~
@1077 = ~You are not the most trustworthy of men. Or of women, for that matter.~
@1078 = ~Judging by your latest deeds, I shouldn't.~
@1079 = ~If I did not trust you, could I trust anyone at all?~
@1080 = ~I do... and time will inevitably show me my mistake.~
@1081 = ~You are my leader. I follow your orders. This is all I have to say.~
@1082 = ~Do you trust yourself?~
@1083 = ~We are going to die. Our lives are fragile; trust is even more so. It will cease to exist regardless.~
@1084 = ~You bring death to anyone and everyone around you, have you forgotten this? You are far too dangerous to be trusted.~
@1085 = ~Thankfully, you are an offspring of Bhaal, not a child of Cyric. Murder is, at least, honest.~
@1086 = ~What should I do, instead? Smile? Sing? Dance?~
@1087 = ~(snort)~
@1088 = ~(Xan scowls and pointedly walks away.)~
@1089 = ~Has it ever come to your attention that I have a reason to do so?~
@1090 = ~Why should I? Life is pointless.~
@1091 = ~When you realize how hopeless everything is, you will stop smiling, as well.~
@1092 = ~Wipe your smug grin from your face. It will only speed you on your way to oblivion.~
@1093 = ~It is my regular facial expression, and I see nothing wrong with it.~
@1094 = ~Oh, very well...~
@1095 = ~(Xan manages a pained smile.)~
@1096 = ~Are you satisfied now?~
@1097 = ~No, no and no! Stop bothering me!~
@1098 = ~It is indeed.~
@1099 = ~Not for long, I assure you.~
@1100 = ~Hm? What are you talking about, <CHARNAME>?~
@1101 = ~I do not have any, so I cannot share your sentiment. But it must be pleasant.~
@1102 = ~Perhaps. I will never know, in any case.~
@1103 = ~I suppose so. I do not regret not having any: my magic more than compensates for this. Though, sometimes...~
@1104 = ~Indeed... though your meaningful looks confuse me, I admit.~
@1105 = ~Our lives are dark and dreary. Friendship, care, love - these are only illusions.~
@1106 = ~I do not think it will help you survive, but you may consider me your friend... I suppose. For the time being.~
@1107 = ~And I am honored by your friendship.~
@1108 = ~Death, of course. What else should I be thinking of?~
@1109 = ~(sigh) We're all doomed.~
@1110 = ~I am thinking of...~
@1111 = ~Never mind.~
@1112 = ~Of fighting Providence, as we often do. It will not end well.~
@1113 = ~I am thinking of revenge. It is a dish best served with a very large weapon, the larger the better. I doubt you have one, though.~
@1114 = ~Life... is a never-ending string of terrible humiliating defeats, and my own string is coming to an end. But at least Arvandor is a happy place.~
@1115 = ~(Xan produces a deep sigh, full of exhaustion and weariness with the world's affairs.)~
@1116 = ~Better a life of misery than an eternity of regret. I do not want to die.~
@1117 = ~I have been recounting my many mistakes. If only I could turn the tide of time... (sigh)~
@1118 = ~You are younger than me: perhaps you will be lucky enough to avoid these pitfalls. I wish you well, in any case.~
@1119 = ~I do not want to continue adventuring. I do not want to live. My duty, my city, my home - all these are doomed, <CHARNAME>, doomed! There is no point, don't you see that?~
@1120 = ~Of course.~
@1121 = ~Indeed? Why, thank you for reminding me.~
@1122 = ~It is unlike you to imitate my behavior. Are you all right?~
@1123 = ~Oh? I do hope you are well.~
@1124 = ~Hm? You do not seem yourself.~
@1125 = ~I know it very well. Better than I would have wanted to, alas.~
@1126 = ~We deserve it. We killed so many, and some of them for such little gain... it is barbaric.~
@1127 = ~How many innocent travelers have you murdered? I dare say that you *are* doomed, and I am with you.~
@1128 = ~Yes... we are.~
@1129 = ~Yes, we are doomed to die. But we are also doomed to cling to life. Who knows what will win?~
@1130 = ~No, <CHARNAME>. You are competent enough, I suppose.~
@1131 = ~So you could blame me for your mistakes? No, thank you.~
@1132 = ~I dare say you've more than enough advisers already.~
@1133 = ~Try to engage in every second brawl as opposed to every single one. It will definitely be an improvement.~
@1134 = ~(sigh) Be careful, <CHARNAME>.~
@1135 = ~If you start to watch the road instead of engaging in pointless conversation, I'll consider my job done.~
@1136 = ~Speak little, listen and observe. What else can I say?~
@1137 = ~I do not know. Try to keep a journal, so you are able to compare today with your past experiences. Perhaps it will help you in the long run.~
@1138 = ~If you will, be more reasonable in your demands. They may be the death of you one day.~
@1139 = ~Take along some competent companions. The more the better... provided they are not the type to stab you in the back, of course.~
@1140 = ~Indeed. My finest robes, my new boots...~
@1141 = ~(sigh) Sometimes I feel as if I am about to give up all my magic for a change of linen.~
@1142 = ~Do you think it will ever end?~
@1143 = ~(groan) I could not agree with you more.~
@1144 = ~Perhaps you will now consider resting in taverns, not in slums and sewers. Think on it, will you?~
@1145 = ~Dirt, muck, insects, monotony, danger, rashes, infections, disarray, blatant intimacies - I can recount my miseries endlessly, but will you listen?~
@1146 = ~My back hurts, my feet are sore, and I cannot look at my own fingernails without throwing up. This adventure is grinding on my nerves.~
@1147 = ~Tired of road, hills, rocks, endless trails of dust, dirty water... ah, but it's no use.~
@1148 = ~You are simply fatigued, <CHARNAME>. Why don't you call a halt?~
@1149 = ~We are ever at war with these, and we are ever losing. Worse, there is no escape.~
@1150 = ~You will lose this battle, sooner or later. But you know it already, don't you?~
@1151 = ~It doomed you in the most certain way, and there is no escape.~
@1152 = ~I am sorry, <CHARNAME>. I am sorry...~
@1153 = ~Your life must be truly unendurable because of it. But this is just another platitude.~
@1154 = ~What do *you* think of your heritage? Do you keep fighting, or are you about to surrender?~
@1155 = ~Your heritage is not your destiny. It is your doom. Fight it, while you can.~
@1156 = ~It is an important part of who you are, and a sad one.~
@1157 = ~You may compare it to a burning diamond, or to something as poetic and meaningless. To me, it is something dark and slimy at the bottom of your soul.~
@1158 = ~I am trying not to.~
@1159 = ~There is no point.~
@1160 = ~You do not wish me to spread doom and gloom further, do you?~
@1161 = ~I have no desire to. There is so little point in this day and age, and so much sadness, that I would rather spend my remaining - hours? minutes? - in silence.~
@1162 = ~If you would forgive a trite sentiment, I wish to thank you. For accepting me, for listening and understanding... though I have my doubts about the last point.~
@1163 = ~I considered leaving, to be honest. However, I see that you need my services, so I will stay for the time being. But it is going to be difficult.~
@1164 = ~To<DAYNIGHT> is one of the most unpleasant <DAYNIGHT>s I can ever recall. Though there will be worse ones to come - if I will even survive this one, that is.~
@1165 = ~Nothing. Oh, wait... I do.~
@1166 = ~If anything happens to me, do not bother resurrecting my body. I have had enough of this misery.~
@1167 = ~What should I speak of? Misfortune? I need not recount ours to you, I am sure, and neither will I speak of my own.~
@1168 = ~What is there to say? Life is so hollow...~
@1169 = ~No. Why should I?~
@1170 = ~(Xan walks next to you, lost in his thoughts.)~ [O#XAN000]

@1172 = ~(Kiss Xan)~
@1173 = ~(Sigh)~
@1174 = ~(Sulk)~
@1175 = ~(Tease Xan)~
@1176 = ~(Smile at Xan)~
@1177 = ~(Caress Xan)~
@1178 = ~(Cuddle with Xan)~
@1179 = ~(Ambush Xan)~
@1180 = ~(Hold hands with Xan)~
@1181 = ~Xan, I am so scared...~
@1182 = ~(Do nothing)~
@1183 = ~(Lean and as elegant as one can be in these circumstances, Xan changed little over the last year. But a few months ago he had neither those deep shadows under his eyes, nor the constant tiredness in his face.)~
@1184 = ~(He yawns and sighs, obviously fatigued again.)~
@1185 = ~(Xan's smooth face is unreadable. Whether he thinks about your previous conversation, his former home or vengeance against Irenicus, you have no idea.)~
@1186 = ~(He walks with his moonblade drawn, his face pale and set. Light blue sparkles come off the fading sword and illuminate Xan's face, making it seem eerie and unreal.)~
@1187 = ~(Xan's face is half-hidden by the hood of his robes, but you manage to glimpse his expression. It is strangely serene, almost beautiful.)~
@1188 = ~(You know what he is thinking about.)~
@1189 = ~(He limps slightly after the last battle. Noticing your attention, Xan throws you a look which clearly speaks of annoyance.)~
@1190 = ~(His face softens, but a mute plea in his eyes remains, and you are forced to turn away.)~
@1191 = ~(Without several layers of fabric obscuring the view, his behind would have been a truly spectacular sight, but as it is, it is still not that bad. Certainly, he could do without his cloak... and the swordbelt... and his backpack... and his robes, for that matter... To think of it, why do mages need clothes at all?)~
@1192 = ~(You shake the weird thought away. However by Xan's faint, amused half-smile you suspect that it was not exactly yours in the first place.)~
@1193 = ~(Xan is checking with his spellbook, and you take a moment to regard him fully.)~
@1194 = ~(Beautiful even among the race which cultivates beauty, he draws eyes... but with his painfully hunched shoulders, adventuring robes spattered with mud and grime, and always tending one injury or another, you are not surprised that few spare him a second glance.)~
@1195 = ~(Xan raises his eyes and stares at you thoughtfully.)~
@1196 = ~You were thinking of me, were you not? Not surprisingly, so was I. (sigh) I will forget all my spells with you...~
@1197 = ~What is it, <CHARNAME>? Do you need anything?~
@1198 = ~(Xan turns to glance at you at the same time as you turn to regard him. Both of you caught off-guard, you stare at each other in bewilderment. Xan actually breaks into a smile, this time.)~
@1199 = ~(Your past experiences left a mark. Xan is thinner than he was a year ago, and his robes hang on him as on a peg. You notice speckles of gray in his hair, and his fine features are constantly creased with worry as if lined.)~
@1200 = ~(Noticing your gaze, he gives you a calm, affectionate look.)~
@1201 = ~It will be all right, <CHARNAME>. It must be. You are with me, after all.~
@1202 = ~Mmm... That was...~
@1203 = ~Come here again.~
@1204 = ~(Xan kisses you back - a long, painfully slow kiss which leaves the taste of burnt roses on your tongue.)~
@1205 = ~(You step back and open your palm. A dried red rose lies there.)~
@1206 = ~(How your lips managed to miss his, you will never know. But it soon becomes the least of your concerns, as his lips and tongue run along the curves of your ear, cheek and throat, murmuring something wistful but strangely appropriate.)~
@1207 = ~(You get your kiss much later than you have expected.)~
@1208 = ~(His lips are salty and dry, and his eyes are dangerously moist and bright... but they close with pleasure as he kisses you deeper, and all thought vanishes.)~
@1209 = ~(What starts as a brief kiss soon gets out of hand, as pressure and pleasure build. His fingers get lost in your hair entirely, then travel lower to caress the back of your neck. The kiss leaves you slightly dazed. For one, the question how both of your hands ended up firmly holding his ears will forever remain a mystery.)~
@1210 = ~(Xan pulls back first and sighs with exasperation. He does not let go of your hands, however.)~
@1211 = ~If I find out that I have forgotten all my spells as a result, you will be held personally responsible. Though it will not trouble you much, will it?~
@1212 = ~(Within seconds, you find yourself in the center of the whirlpool. His lips are desperate and hungry, his hands press you hard against him, his eyes burn your skin... you have a momentary vision of two forms entwined... but it is over all too soon.)~
@1213 = ~(Xan gives you an ironic look and steps to his usual place in line, right behind you.)~
@1214 = ~<CHARNAME>, stop. Another minute, and I will die in your sight.~
@1215 = ~Not to mention in plain view of everyone, which will be rather embarrassing. Don't you think?~
@1216 = ~(Xan kisses you briefly, but his mind seems to wander. For a few moments, he holds you close, his fingertips keep trailing patterns down your spine. Then, just as absently, he lets go.)~
@1217 = ~What, again? (sigh) But resisting you is a pointless task, it seems...~
@1218 = ~Beautiful... is this a perfect place? I think not.~
@1219 = ~Later, <CHARNAME>. Later.~
@1220 = ~(Xan kisses you back softly.)~
@1221 = ~(He answers your kiss in equal measure, and his half-closed eyes shine brighter than you have ever seen them shine before.)~
@1222 = ~(Xan's lips part slightly, then open fully to meet yours. The kiss lasts for such a long time that you are unsure how you breathe at all, and, judging by Xan's puzzled expression, neither does he. He does not seem to mind, however, for he closes your eyes, pulls you closer... and the miracle continues.)~
@1223 = ~(He squeezes your hand silently.)~
@1224 = ~(Xan gives you a worried look.)~
@1225 = ~(Xan raises an eyebrow, but, upon seeing the expression on your face, an ironic look gives way to a concerned one.)~
@1226 = ~(He walks by your side for the next half-hour.)~
@1227 = ~(Xan sighs in return, a deep, mournful sigh, which surpasses yours by far.)~
@1228 = ~(Xan sighs, too, and you start a second round with another sigh. His own is quick to follow, and you continue your sighing match for several minutes.)~
@1229 = ~(He is all too eager to finish it with a kiss.)~
@1230 = ~(Xan's fingers find and absentmindedly grasp yours.)~
@1231 = ~(Xan turns and gives you a weak smile.)~
@1232 = ~(Despite your half-hearted protest, Xan wraps his arm around your neck and shoulders, not letting go for nearly a minute.)~
@1233 = ~(Xan nods wistfully, echoing your sigh with his.)~
@1234 = ~(For the next hour, Xan glances at you rather more often than is strictly necessary.)~
@1235 = ~(Xan approaches you, very quietly, and takes your hand.)~
@1236 = ~Beautiful... it will pass.~
@1237 = ~(For several minutes, you proceed in gloomy silence. Then you hear a rustling noise, and a small and crispy package is pressed into your hand.)~
@1238 = ~(You open it up, and rich, forward fragrance bursts into your face. The package is full of large, juicy blackberries. Never a particular delicacy, they still look tempting enough to try...)~
@1239 = ~(As to who gave it to you, you have a shrewd suspicion. Xan certainly peers upon the package with much interest, but meets your eyes with a carefully blank look.)~
@1240 = ~(Xan rolls his eyes and makes a point of walking as far from you as possible.)~
@1241 = ~(A small chuckle behind your back makes you turn around.)~
@1242 = ~You are precious when you do this, <CHARNAME>. But do not let me detain you from your moods. I withdraw.~
@1243 = ~(You keep walking wrapped in doom and gloom, never raising your gaze from your feet. Then a small bright spot near your ankle attracts your attention. It moves with you, shifting slightly as you walk, and grows brighter. Finally you realize that it is a speck of sunlight, though its strange behavior is a puzzle to you - )~
@1244 = ~( - right until the moment you turn around, catching Xan in the act. His eyes are fixed on your feet, and he mutters furiously under his breath. Noticing you, he drops his hands and sighs in defeat.)~
@1245 = ~I knew it would be of no use...~
@1246 = ~(Xan takes your hand, his expression equally sullen. Then he turns and smiles at you: a bright, sincere and completely uncharacteristic smile.)~
@1247 = ~(You feel the corners of your mouth quirk up.)~
@1248 = ~(Xan leans over you, and your smiles merge into one.)~
@1249 = ~(Xan sighs and wraps an arm around your waist.)~
@1250 = ~Little one... are you all right?~
@1251 = ~(You are thinking of your griefs and burdens, when a sudden snowfall makes you sneeze.)~
@1252 = ~(You raise your head only to see jasmine petals guided to you by gentle wind. Upon turning your head further, you see that it is directed by Xan's long fingers, loosed for casting. He gives you a wan, tired smile and shows an empty pouch before shoving it between his other bags of spell components.)~
@1253 = ~(The last blossom rests on his fingertip. With a muffled whisper, Xan guides it towards your lips, momentarily sealing them with a wave of strong and sweet wind. It feels like a kiss.)~
@1254 = ~(Xan seems to take advantage of your pensive mood. His head is only slightly turned towards you, but his gaze upon you is intense, taking in the whole of you, never missing a single detail.)~
@1255 = ~(He swallows hard and turns away with an obvious effort.)~
@1256 = ~(You walk forward, swaying your hips just a little more than necessary.)~
@1257 = ~<CHARNAME>, stop toying with me. We shall not be able to be alone for hours, so... why?~
@1258 = ~(You give Xan a long, promising look over your shoulder.)~
@1259 = ~Oh, <CHARNAME>, <CHARNAME>...~
@1260 = ~(You grace Xan with a slow, wide smile. The sparkle in your eyes, half-sultry, half-predatory, is impossible to miss.)~
@1261 = ~(Instead of a blush you half-expected, you get a very interested look. Were it anyone else but Xan, you could swear that the fire in his eyes rivals yours.)~
@1262 = ~(You toss your head playfully, spilling your tresses, and squint at Xan, checking for the desired effect. He is not in place, however, and you wonder where your lover might be.)~
@1263 = ~(He emerges next to your elbow with a couple of pins in his hand and quickly rearranges your hair, silencing you with a kiss.)~
@1264 = ~(Your hairdo feels loose and precarious, but as you turn your head right and left, it stays glued in place. Xan watches your antics with mild amusement.)~
@1265 = ~At least something is permanent in this most insecure of worlds... if only for a few hours.~
@1266 = ~(You are sure that you have never looked as beautiful as you do now, and you are taking your chance to show it to your appreciative audience.)~
@1267 = ~(Xan tentatively reaches out, tucks a wayward strand of your hair behind your ear and tries to speak, but his breath seems to catch in his windpipe, and instead, he simply gives you a long, tender look.)~
@1268 = ~(Xan's eyes shine at your teasing smile, creating a disturbing contrast with the rest of his face.)~
@1269 = ~Hmm? Oh, yes, you are beautiful. Was it what you were trying to show?~
@1270 = ~(You lean forward much further than necessary. Xan does not keep you waiting: his eyebrows raise higher than you ever thought possible.)~
@1271 = ~Why the acrobatics, <CHARNAME>? You have my full and undivided attention without these... tricks.~
@1272 = ~(Completely accidentally, you show much more leg than you should.)~
@1273 = ~(Unfortunately, Xan does not notice it.)~
@1274 = ~Ah... <CHARNAME>, what was... *that*... for?~
@1275 = ~(Xan watches your slow, enticing, deliberate walk, forgetting to move or breathe.)~
@1276 = ~I do wonder whether I deserve... this. You.~
@1277 = ~(Xan gives you a vexed look.)~
@1278 = ~(You are rewarded with an absent, fond smile.)~
@1279 = ~What is it? Are my clothes in disarray or - ~
@1280 = ~Oh. I am paranoid, am I? You were simply smiling... I am sorry.~
@1281 = ~(Xan decisively purses his lips, obviously intent on staying as sombre as possible. Your beaming face breaks his resistance, however, and his mouth bends into a crooked grin.)~
@1282 = ~(He shakes his head, seemingly annoyed at himself.)~
@1283 = ~What is there to smile about? I do not see - ~
@1284 = ~(Xan suddenly interrupts himself, cradles you in his arms and kisses the top of your head.)~
@1285 = ~But of course. You.~
@1286 = ~(Xan's eyes smile back, even if his face remains completely serious. Hmmm... it was not a wink you just saw, was it?)~
@1287 = ~(Xan stares at you, confused.)~
@1288 = ~(Xan never tears his eyes off you, drinking in your image.)~
@1289 = ~Was the news of Irenicus' demise made public today? I can picture no other reason for your sudden happiness.~
@1290 = ~(Xan pinks just a little bit.)~
@1291 = ~You are not thinking of what I think you are thinking, are you?~
@1292 = ~(Your fingers travel up and down Xan's arms, relaxing his tense muscles. He murmurs something appreciative and draws you closer by your elbows, so you end up stroking each other's arms.)~
@1293 = ~(You finish your mutual caresses with a long, soft kiss.)~
@1294 = ~(Xan shivers when you start stroking his face, but does not protest.)~
@1295 = ~(Xan incredulously stares at your fingers tap-dancing on his chest.)~
@1296 = ~Is there something you wish to tell me?~
@1297 = ~(You start stroking his shoulders, and Xan involuntary moves closer, ending up in a tight embrace with you, your nose pressed against the hollow of his throat. You feel him smiling as you nestle against him with a contented sigh.)~
@1298 = ~Mmm... It is a pity that we will likely die tomorrow and will not be able to continue these... indulgences.~
@1299 = ~(You spend several delightful moments caressing Xan's lustrous mane of brown hair. He responds with the same caress, cautiously weighing your tresses between his fingers. For the next few minutes, you are fully absorbed in each other.)~
@1300 = ~(You place your palms on Xan's shoulders, bringing him near. The front of his cloak is dark with dust, so he throws it down and puts his arms around you. You spend several minutes in total relaxation, Xan's skin warm through his silken robe.)~
@1301 = ~Mmmmm... don't go. (sigh) I do not want you to.~
@1302 = ~(You run your fingers up his sword sheath and grasp the moonblade's hilt with a very firm and pointed gesture.)~
@1303 = ~Oh? I wonder what exactly you meant by this...~
@1304 = ~(You quietly approach Xan and start stroking his back through his clothes. For a minute, there is no reaction. Then Xan turns and gently slides from under your hands.)~
@1305 = ~Thank you... but I do not deserve this. Not after I left you to Irenicus' mercy. But what you have just done was very, very pleasant.~
@1306 = ~(Xan regards your smaller frame against his in some surprise.)~
@1307 = ~<CHARNAME>... do you know how small you are? The great and fierce daughter of Bhaal? It is incredible.~
@1308 = ~(Xan frees himself almost immediately, his eyes on your surroundings.)~
@1309 = ~(Xan gently guides your head towards his shoulder, sighs and whispers.)~
@1310 = ~If "love eternal" is the answer, then "what will we never have?" must be the question. But a moment of peace, we shall.~
@1311 = ~(Xan glances at your weapon warily, but allows you to curl yourself against him. He puts one arm around you, and picks up your right hand with another.)~
@1312 = ~(Your wrist is splattered with blood, blood that is not yours. Xan starts to wipe it, but it does not seem to go off.)~
@1313 = ~(He does not say anything, but lets go of your arm and disentangles from you shortly afterwards. You proceed in uneasy silence.)~
@1314 = ~(Xan holds you - tightly, impulsively, pressing you against him with all the force he is able to muster. Seeming to realize that it must hurt, he releases you with a brief apology, but continues to watch you with troubled eyes long after you withdraw.)~
@1315 = ~(You place your backpack on the ground and literally fall into Xan's arms. He is eager to catch you, and does not miss a chance to rub his nose against yours briefly when he does. You spend a minute in a sweet, unusually light-hearted embrace, doing small and silly things away from the eyes and ears of others.)~
@1316 = ~(Xan shakes his head warningly at your approach. You stop next to him, and notice a small jar in his hands.)~
@1317 = ~This potion is a sly one, and difficult to handle, so stand still. Embracing me is NOT the best alternative.~
@1318 = ~(Within a minute, his manipulations are over, and you melt into a soft, intimate embrace which you do not break soon.)~
@1319 = ~Another time, <CHARNAME>. Death, danger... another time.~
@1320 = ~(This time, your embrace is rather more passionate than suited for public. Certainly, Xan drops his arms with some reluctance, and you do not fail to notice that his breathing is heavy and uneven.)~
@1321 = ~(You are about to draw apart, when a slight stinging in your chest catches your attention.)~
@1322 = ~(You look down and see a large yellow rose in full bloom, dangling tantalizingly in the narrow space between you two. You reach out to pick it up, but it is too late. The flower twitches and falls down soundlessly, where it lies in the dust.)~
@1323 = ~(Xan tries and fails to look indifferent.)~
@1324 = ~(It is difficult to keep balance with an armful of Bhaalspawn, but Xan somehow manages it. He does not look at all pleased, however.)~
@1325 = ~(Xan is too fast for you this time. Before you are able to react, he reaches out, pins your arms and pulls you to his side.)~
@1326 = ~Must you be so insufferably beautiful?~
@1327 = ~Beautiful? No, I meant... Childish was what I wanted to say. Childish, not beautiful, magnificent or alluring in any way. Childish! (groan) <CHARNAME>, what are you doing to me?~
@1328 = ~(Xan's sensitive skin responds to your tickles all too quickly. Before long, he buries his head in his hands, seized by fits of uncontrollable laughter. This leaves him defenseless, and, with an evil grin, you proceed with your mischievous task.)~
@1329 = ~(When you are finished, he lies on the ground with closed eyes, groaning. It takes him several minutes to come to himself. He marches past you with a resigned sigh, and does not speak to you again for several hours.)~
@1330 = ~<CHARNAME>, what in the Nine Hells - Let go of me!~
@1331 = ~(Your assault comes unexpected. Xan stumbles, falls to one knee and sharply pushes his hands forward to protect you from falling. His arms immediately wrap around your waist. A live picture of a knight and his princess... or, in your case, a half-goddess and her sorcerer...)~
@1332 = ~(Wrapped in a heavy, thick cloak, Xan does not notice you at first, but you snake your arms to his waist, and his reaction is immediate. Xan gasps and firmly pushes you away, letting you stay at arm's length.)~
@1333 = ~<CHARNAME>, much as I dislike to do this, some day I will have to do the same to you. Perhaps then you will change your attitude.~
@1334 = ~(Xan does not resist as you pounce upon him. He simply waves a hand, weaving a quick but complex pattern, and next moment you stand in front of him immobile.)~
@1335 = ~Now, before your behavior has killed us all, what do I do with you?~
@1336 = ~(sigh) Nothing, it seems.~
@1337 = ~(He kisses you on the cheek and lifts the spell.)~
@1338 = ~(You break into a run and jump at Xan's neck, giggling, squealing and showering his face and neck with kisses.)~
@1339 = ~(He rolls his eyes in exasperation, but you are not fooled. This serene, warm expression you only see in the most intimate moments tells you all you need to know. That Xan desperately tries to hide his face does not help him a little bit.)~
@1340 = ~(Your lover reached the end of his tether, it seems. His own ambush comes completely out of the blue, fast, soft hands running all over your body, and lips echoing their movements all over your face.)~
@1341 = ~(He steps back and blinks.)~
@1342 = ~I do not know what came over me, but if it keeps your ambushes at bay, I shall be more than glad to repeat the experience.~
@1343 = ~<CHARNAME>, your devotion to giggling, tickling and other mature activities is remarkable, but don't you think that you would enjoy them more if employed sparsely? Think on it, won't you?~
@1344 = ~(Xan looks at you bemusedly. Then the corner of his mouth quirks up. You proceed arm in arm, your hand resting comfortably in his.)~
@1345 = ~(His fingers are cut and bruised. Xan winces and awkwardly throws your hand off.)~
@1346 = ~(His fingers swiftly close on yours. By the looks of him, Xan is not letting go any time soon.)~
@1347 = ~(His fingers are damp with some liquid, slick and very cold. You instinctively free your hand.)~
@1348 = ~(sigh) Such is life. Some of my spell components are not nice at all.~
@1349 = ~(Xan's fingers slide down your wrist and interlace with yours, his on top and your palm exposed.)~
@1350 = ~(He brings your joined hands to his lips and kisses your wrist, slowly advancing to the tips of your fingers. Then he disentwines your hands and takes your arm again. Now your palm, locked with his, holds both fresh memories of his kisses and the warm, real touch of his skin.)~
@1351 = ~(As you touch his hand, Xan gives you a strange look. You follow his gaze and see a peculiar combination on the juncture of your palms. Two lines meet there: yours and his. But yours continues beyond, streaming into your wrist, while his is cut sharply.)~
@1352 = ~(Xan pales and closes his palm, taking those symbols, whatever they meant, out of your sight.)~
@1353 = ~(Xan looks at your coupled hands, smiles wistfully and kisses your shoulder.)~
@1354 = ~I will cling to you always. But will you?~
@1355 = ~(Xan shakes his head negatively and frees his arm.)~
@1356 = ~<CHARNAME>, I need my fingers loosed for casting, not frivolities!~
@1357 = ~...I am sorry. But we are to be killed any moment. I will never forgive myself if you fall.~
@1358 = ~(snort) Of course. The best and fastest remedy against Irenicus and his minions: my hand. Ingenious...~
@1359 = ~(He does not take his hand away, however.)~
@1360 = ~Beautiful... I am with you.~
@1361 = ~It will be all r - ~
@1362 = ~Shhh... I am here.~
@1363 = ~(sigh) I wish I could have big strong <CHARNAME> come over to comfort me. As it is... come here.~
@1364 = ~(shudder) You have no idea as to how I am scared...~
@1365 = ~Well, there is a slim chance we'll emerge alive... but it is slim indeed.~
@1366 = ~(Xan sighs and pulls you close, holding you around the shoulders like he would a frightened child.)~
@1367 = ~There will be a victory. I do not know why or how, but there will be one.~
@1368 = ~Why? We are doomed, don't you know this?~
@1369 = ~Though not you, I hope. Never you.~
@1370 = ~What... what is it, <CHARNAME>? I will do anything for you, just do not look at me like this... please.~
@1371 = ~It will, if you do not mind an utter lie, be all right. Come, we still have tomorrow.~
@1372 = ~(Xan gives you a furtive glance out of the corner of his eye.)~ [O#XAN000]
@1373 = ~(Hug Xan)~
@1374 = ~(Grin at Xan)~
@1375 = ~(Pout at Xan)~
@1376 = ~(Stare at Xan)~
@1377 = ~(Tickle Xan)~
@1378 = ~(Stumble)~
@1379 = ~(Show off to Xan)~
@1380 = ~(Make eyes at Xan)~
@1381 = ~(Blow a kiss at Xan)~
@1382 = ~Ah... thank you, <CHARNAME>, but it was completely unnecessary.~
@1383 = ~Are you all right? Embracing someone in public... worse, embracing *me* in public - is rather suspicious.~
@1384 = ~(Xan gasps with surprise, but obediently puts his arms around you.)~
@1385 = ~(Xan closes his eyes and sighs into your hair.)~
@1386 = ~(Even through his robes and cloak, his arms are cold as ice. You shiver, and he lets you go at once.)~
@1387 = ~(Xan arches an eyebrow at your advance, but holds you in return. His fingers slide down your back and close around your left hand. It looks like he wants to bring it to his lips, but then thinks better of it.)~
@1388 = ~(Xan sighs and shakes his head.)~
@1389 = ~<CHARNAME>, this is not the time and place.~
@1390 = ~(Xan stiffens and steps back, extending an arm to support you.)~
@1391 = ~Another moment, and you would have walked into the center of a dangerous spell! Do you even understand - ~
@1392 = ~Never mind. Pointless to explain the risks involved to carelessness personified.~
@1393 = ~(Xan barely responds, his eyes anywhere but on your face. He releases you in a few seconds.)~
@1394 = ~(Instead of taking you into his arms, Xan takes your hands and kisses them. His long hair obscures the view, but you can feel the tenderness in his face as he strokes your palms. He lets go very slowly, never taking his eyes off your hands and carefully avoiding your gaze.)~
@1395 = ~(Xan cautiously wraps his arms around you. His left hand is trembling on your shoulder, so warm that it burns your skin. He continues to clutch it with his right long after you break apart.)~
@1396 = ~(You feel him smile as his arms close around you.)~
@1397 = ~(Xan stops you abruptly. He holds you at arm's length, and looks into your eyes with strange intensity. Then his face relaxes, and he presses you close, murmuring something into your hair.)~
@1398 = ~(Xan's arms are wrapped firmly around you, but his body seems limp. You shift uncomfortably, and he withdraws.)~
@1399 = ~(Xan takes you in his arms, holds you firmly and kisses you full on the mouth...)~
@1400 = ~(You open your eyes to Xan's hand on your shoulder.)~
@1401 = ~<CHARNAME>, are you all right? You drifted away for a moment.~
@1402 = ~(Xan raises an eyebrow.)~
@1403 = ~(You are certain that you have seen him smiling, but next moment, he sharply turns away.)~
@1404 = ~(Xan cautiously smiles back.)~
@1405 = ~You are so... so...~
@1406 = ~(Even the tips of Xan's ears seem to perk up.)~
@1407 = ~(Xan gasps in surprise.)~
@1408 = ~(Xan nods politely at your smile and turns away. Was it humming you just heard?)~
@1409 = ~(A small, fleeting smile runs across his face.)~
@1410 = ~A pity you do not see yourself now.~
@1411 = ~(Xan's lips are quivering. He sharply bites his lower lip, and a drop of blood trickles down his chin. Never noticing this, he simply stands and stares into your eyes... then turns away without another word.)~
@1412 = ~<CHARNAME>, would you... like my company for a while?~
@1413 = ~(sigh) I thought not.~
@1414 = ~Oh, if you've nothing to do, there are quite a few unwashed plates and basins in our backpacks.~
@1415 = ~(Xan glances upon you with concern, then reaches out and opens his mouth... but then withdraws without a word.)~
@1416 = ~(Xan gives you a sidelong look from under his eyelashes. His hand makes a small circle in the air, as if about to catch yours; his fingers miss yours by inches. He drops his hand with a leaden sigh which plainly says: 'it was meant to be'.)~
@1417 = ~(Xan's mood is even more sullen then yours. Arms crossed and eyes on the ground, he sees nothing and no one, including you.)~
@1418 = ~Should we lament over our fates together? You certainly look a kindred spirit.~
@1419 = ~(Xan cautiously draws an arm around your shoulders and seizes your fingers with his free hand.)~
@1420 = ~I can never guess whether you are serious or not. It is frightful.~
@1421 = ~(Xan takes your hand in both of his and leans over you.)~
@1422 = ~I would comfort you, but I suspect you'd rather jump out of the window than let me kiss a tip of your finger. Wouldn't you?~
@1423 = ~(sigh) Now you will pout for a tenday. Selfish girl...~
@1424 = ~(Xan leans over his spellbook with his back to you. Whether he ignores you pointedly or not, you do not know... though a furtive look thrown your way tells you more than enough.)~
@1425 = ~(Xan shifts uncomfortably under your gaze and pulls his robes tighter around him.)~
@1426 = ~(Xan gives you a cold, hard stare.)~
@1427 = ~When did you take to spying, <CHARNAME>?~
@1428 = ~(Xan walks beside you with a small, dreamy and very becoming smile.)~
@1429 = ~(Xan flushes under your gaze and buries his face in the cowl of his robe.)~
@1430 = ~Hm? Is there something you need?~
@1431 = ~(Xan shivers in apparent discomfort and carefully steps away from you.)~
@1432 = ~(You scrutinize his lean build for several moments. For a mage of a delicate stature, his arms are developed well enough, though he rarely uses them other than for hopeless gesticulation. His fingers are particularly well-defined... but Xan turns to you, confused by your scrutiny, and you have to wrap up your examination.)~
@1433 = ~(Xan's dark eyes dart restlessly from side to side. You take this moment to peer at him.)~
@1434 = ~(His long hair shadows his face, making it seem darker than it actually is. In truth, his skin is pale, though, as you watch, his cheeks pink a little. You suddenly recall that his field of vision is as wide as yours, and step back - only to find yourself face to face with him a minute later.)~
@1435 = ~You need not have run away, <CHARNAME>. I value your... attention.~
@1436 = ~(Xan's walk is fast and irritable. His long brown mane moves left and right, his gaze is fixed forward, and his hand rests on the moonblade's hilt. He is muttering to himself, but you are only able to distinguish "Another pointless task...")~
@1437 = ~(The collar of his robes is open, and you are able to get a generous glimpse of the pale, vulnerable skin of his neck and shoulder. Caught in the rhythm of his breathing, you never notice him looking at you - a remarkably tender look that you feel rather than see.)~
@1438 = ~(Xan chokes in your arms and fleetly disentangles himself.)~
@1439 = ~<CHARNAME>, I cannot take this.~
@1440 = ~AH! <CHARNAME>, you - ~
@1441 = ~(He presses you very close and kisses your brow.)~
@1442 = ~You will not do this again. Otherwise...~
@1443 = ~No. Don't. Just don't.~
@1444 = ~(Xan jumps a good few feet and sprawls on the ground, panting.)~
@1445 = ~Another... another attack like this, and I will have to take steps. Not that it'll help, of course.~
@1446 = ~If you do not stop, a certain spell will make you tickle yourself. Would you wish to?~
@1447 = ~<CHARNAME>, you are such a child... (sigh) Should I employ magic to protect myself from you?~
@1448 = ~(Xan looks upward in comical despair.)~
@1449 = ~Corellon, why would you punish me so? Why - Arghhh, <CHARNAME>, stop it! STOP!~
@1450 = ~(Laughing Xan is a rare sight, even if you had to resort to tickling. Certainly, his eyes shine more than they should after such an undignified treatment.)~
@1451 = ~Seldarine, will this torment ever end?~
@1452 = ~You - ~
@1453 = ~No! No, please... pl-please, stop!~
@1454 = ~I'll do anything, but leave - me - alone!~
@1455 = ~(After several minutes of some very satisfactory tickling, you leave Xan wheezing, flushed... and his eyes firmly fixed on your cleavage, as they have been for the whole time. It looks that he does not mind tickling that much, after all.)~
@1456 = ~(Xan darts to you immediately.)~
@1457 = ~Here, let me have a look at your knee... oh.~
@1458 = ~(He flushes.)~
@1459 = ~On the other hand, if you are not hurt...~
@1460 = ~(Xan catches you, his arms just below your chest, and holds you just a moment longer than the circumstances require.)~
@1461 = ~(You regain your balance easily.)~
@1462 = ~(With a loud curse, you fall on the ground, both your kneecaps whole, but bruised and aching.)~
@1463 = ~(You feel a firm pull as you are lifted up - into Xan's arms, at that.)~
@1464 = ~I have no doubt that you will run - no, limp away - at the first opportunity, but would you allow me to carry you for a while?~
@1465 = ~I thought you would.~
@1466 = ~(Xan's purple robes flash before your eyes, and your fall stops. His embarrassment does not, however, since he is now embracing your knees, and his head rests at your hip.)~
@1467 = ~(With an awkward cough, he stands up.)~
@1468 = ~You are doing this on purpose, aren't you?~
@1469 = ~(Xan arches an eyebrow, but steps up to support you.)~
@1470 = ~(You walk, your arm under his elbow, for a short time.)~
@1471 = ~(sigh) How can one so experienced be so - ~
@1472 = ~(You do not hear the word he uses. You look into his eyes, and they are telling you but one word: 'beautiful'.)~
@1473 = ~(With natural grace, you perform a small pirouette and straighten yourself with a flourish.)~
@1474 = ~(Xan watches mesmerized.)~
@1475 = ~(You fall awkwardly, and your forehead bursts with sharp, stinging pain.)~
@1476 = ~...~
@1477 = ~(You come awake to find your head in Xan's lap, and a cool palm on your brow.)~
@1478 = ~<CHARNAME>, you were hurt. You need healing, warmth and several hours of safety. Give us a command to stop, won't you?~
@1479 = ~(You start to play with a small dagger, flickering it in your palm faster and faster.)~
@1480 = ~(Xan pales, bites his lip and tries to turn away, but you see his eyes returning to you again and again.)~
@1481 = ~(You flip your hair at Xan. He blinks at first, but his reflexes get the better of him, and he catches one of your tresses in his hands. For a moment, he regards it with obvious longing. Then he lets it through his fingers, drops his hands and sighs.)~
@1482 = ~(Your elegant and smooth, if slightly provocative, walk draws much attention. Xan's eyes, for one, follow your movements like a magnet. At last, with a deliberate gesture, he puts his hands in the pockets of his robe, looking as if he is preventing them from touching you on their own accord.)~
@1483 = ~(You take an apple from your pack and start taking small bites.)~
@1484 = ~(Some say there are no seductive motives in eating an apple, but Xan is definitely not one of those people. He licks his lips several times, apparently unconsciously, before you are done.)~
@1485 = ~(Your surroundings are not the best place for dancing, but that does not stop you. Your pas are flowing and refined, as befits one of the People, and your face shines with merriment.)~
@1486 = ~(Xan's face shines, too, though he turns away and mutters something about impending doom the moment you approach him. His trembling fingers betray him, however.)~
@1487 = ~(Your voice may not equal those of the great elven bards of old, but your distracted humming is musical enough to draw attention. With Xan, you succeed fully. He even tucks his hair behind his ears to hear you better.)~
@1488 = ~(You are doing everything to shine to<DAYNIGHT>. Sadly, Xan does not notice. He has this dreamy expression of his again, though...)~
@1489 = ~Oh. <CHARNAME>, why did you have to do *that* in the first place?~
@1490 = ~(You sharply raise your arms up and send yourself into a series of cartwheels, ending at Xan's feet.)~
@1491 = ~(Predictably, you do not stop there. With full force, you bump into Xan, and both of you are sent tumbling, you on top.)~
@1492 = ~(A pair of dark, slanted, wide eyes stares into yours.)~
@1493 = ~Don't... do not scare me like this again. I... I was...~
@1494 = ~(sigh) Nothing. Let us go.~
@1495 = ~(Xan turns his head at your antics, and his face relaxes into a small smile. You have never seen him smiling at anyone like this.)~
@1496 = ~(You wink at Xan and receive a cool, polite nod in return.)~
@1497 = ~(He draws a long, shuddering breath, never taking his eyes from your face, and you feel your skin burning.)~
@1498 = ~(Xan winces and flushes.)~
@1499 = ~(You use an old, well-known technique proven with time. Your eyes fall to the side, observing a dark corner, then flick to your nose, and finally, rest on Xan.)~
@1500 = ~(After repeating the trick several times, you feel slightly cross-eyed, but an intricate blush on Xan's face may just be worth it.)~
@1501 = ~(Xan looks at you cautiously.)~
@1502 = ~You are... you are not making eyes at me, are you?~
@1503 = ~(Xan grumbles something suspiciously like "What is the point?", though his face bears another message.)~
@1504 = ~(Xan takes your hand and gingerly kisses you on the cheek.)~
@1505 = ~That was what you expected, I believe?~
@1506 = ~(Xan throws a quick look around, making sure that no one is in the vicinity, and takes a single step towards you.)~
@1507 = ~(He slowly, reverently puts his arms around you and kisses you between your eyes.)~
@1508 = ~I could say I could not help it, but it would be a lie. I could. I simply chose not to.~
@1509 = ~(Xan regards the movements of your eyes in puzzlement.)~
@1510 = ~Not the question I should ask, perhaps... but how do you do it?~
@1511 = ~(sigh) Coquetry. Naked, cruel and pointless coquetry. But it becomes you, I admit.~
@1512 = ~(Xan's hand, cool and smooth, carefully wraps around yours.)~
@1513 = ~Are you sure? We are in danger, and... but very well.~
@1514 = ~(He gives your hand a strange look before taking it.)~
@1515 = ~(You walk hand in hand for some time. When you break apart, Xan's palm lingers in yours. You feel him slipping something small and round there.)~
@1516 = ~(A dried grape.)~
@1517 = ~(A fig.)~
@1518 = ~(A hazelnut.)~
@1519 = ~(A strawberry.)~
@1520 = ~(A truffle.)~
@1521 = ~No... not now.~
@1522 = ~(Xan takes your hand with a small bow.)~
@1523 = ~Why, you were reading my thoughts.~
@1524 = ~(Xan laces his fingers with yours, and his eyes smile.)~
@1525 = ~I thought you would prefer that it was not my hand, but the one belonging to... (sigh) Never mind.~
@1526 = ~(Xan is about to take your hand, when he kneels and frowns. There is a small cut on your index finger.)~
@1527 = ~(He lightly strokes your palm, gets up and takes your other hand.)~
@1528 = ~(Xan blinks, apparently bewildered as to how your hand ended up in his. He does not dwell on it long, however.)~
@1529 = ~How can your hand stay so soft? I wonder...~
@1530 = ~(Xan eyes your lips longingly.)~
@1531 = ~(Xan makes a motion as if to catch it, then shrugs, smiles wryly and deliberately walks away.)~
@1532 = ~Are you sure it is for me? I doubt it.~
@1533 = ~(Xan darts to you, his cloak and hair obscuring the view, and briefly, fleetingly kisses you on the lips.)~
@1534 = ~(Xan looks at you as if he is doubting your sanity.)~
@1535 = ~What for, <CHARNAME>?~
@1536 = ~(He slowly brings his hand to his lips. It stays there for a long time.)~
@1537 = ~<CHARNAME>...~
@1538 = ~(Xan turns and deftly catches your hand in the air. For several moments, he holds it in his own, unsure. Then something changes in his face, and he delicately brings his lips to your palm.)~
@1539 = ~(Xan throws you a fervent look which speaks volumes.)~
@1540 = ~(Xan takes a single glance at you and immediately clasps your hand.)~
@1541 = ~I understand. But I cannot chase your fears away. I cannot...~
@1542 = ~Yes, I see it. Even your cloak is trembling on your shoulders. (sigh) Come here.~
@1543 = ~(Xan takes a step back and gives you an ironical look.)~
@1544 = ~You, the daughter of Bhaal, afraid? I will never believe this... though... wait. I do. Forgive me, <CHARNAME>... I do. Here... if I could hold you for a moment...~
@1545 = ~I would kiss you to chase your fears away... I am tempted, at least. But will it help?~
@1546 = ~I will not leave your side. In peace or in danger, I will not. Does it... does it help?~
@1547 = ~I thought not.~
@1548 = ~(Xan's expression softens.)~
@1549 = ~Beautiful...~
@1550 = ~I am with you. For what it is worth, I am with you.~
@1551 = ~So am I. We both fear what is to come, do we not?~
@1552 = ~I know.~
@1553 = ~(Xan walks beside you, his gaze fixed on his feet.)~ [O#XAN000]
@1554 = ~You have been rather silent as of late. Are you ignoring me?~
@1555 = ~You know, as a mage and a member of my group, you are not that bad.~
@1556 = ~You are totally useless!~
@1557 = ~Your astuteness amazes me. Yes, I do. It was your own desire, wasn't it?~
@1558 = ~Why, thank you, <CHARNAME>.~
@1559 = ~If only it helped us survive... (sigh) But I know it will not.~
@1560 = ~Come to think of it, for a Child of Murder you are not hopeless, either.~
@1561 = ~Perhaps. But it changes nothing. We all are going to die.~
@1562 = ~Are you telling this, because you are going to send me on another hopeless mission? Or do you want to show your benign nature?~
@1563 = ~Indeed? Look at yourself. How useful are you, a Child of Murder who leaves corpses everywhere <HESHE> goes? My magic can do much, much more... but you only use it to render our enemies helpless and loot them naked.~
@1564 = ~I do not revel in murder. Subtle arts are more useful, though hardly honorable. But victory and honor rarely go together, do they?~
@1565 = ~Why do you allow me to stay, then? Surely, there is more than enough material for replacement? A barbarian, a berserker, a suicide monger - you will be happier with any of them, if a talented mage's methods are beyond your ability to comprehend.~
@1566 = ~Keep your rudeness to yourself. Otherwise I am going to take my considerable powers somewhere else, and given that every second citizen of Amn is your enemy, the chances are high that we shall have to fight each other. And you would not want to end up killing yourself in despair, now, would you?~
@1567 = ~Do you find any pleasure in repeating this, I wonder?~
@1568 = ~Ask, if you must.~
@1569 = ~Can you tell me of your mission again?~
@1570 = ~What happened to your moonblade? It was brighter before.~
@1571 = ~If you are a Greycloak, why do you wear purple?~
@1572 = ~Will you stay with me after I deal with Irenicus?~
@1573 = ~What does it mean to be a moonblade wielder?~
@1574 = ~Xan, you are a moon elf. What does it mean?~
@1575 = ~Could you tell me more about yourself?~
@1576 = ~Could you tell me about your family?~
@1577 = ~Could you tell me of Evereska?~
@1578 = ~What is your opinion of my leadership?~
@1579 = ~Why did you become an enchanter?~
@1580 = ~You were robbed some time before you met me, weren't you? Tell me.~
@1581 = ~Do you fear anything? Er, no, scratch that. Is there anything you are *not* paranoid of?~
@1582 = ~We are bonded... and Irenicus has my soul. Do you feel him, as you felt me?~
@1583 = ~No, nothing.~
@1584 = ~Strange things started to happen around Athkatla. Established routes were cut, people disappeared, undead were seen in the streets, and so on. I was sent to investigate, and I need your assistance. I truly do, for I cannot complete this task alone.~
@1585 = ~You are performing it already. Shadow Thieves are our allies against an army of undead. Once it is destroyed, my mission will be complete. While their leader is alive, however, it is not.~
@1586 = ~It is peculiar that you should ask, when you are working for the one I have sworn to destroy. She will use you, swallow you whole and barely notice. I do not know why I agreed to this, now that my mission is more hopeless as ever.~
@1587 = ~You will participate in it soon. Don't you want to kill that treacherous abomination, Bodhi, for her traps, lies and mind games? I know I do.~
@1588 = ~What for? It is over. Bodhi is dead, and I shall depart to Evereska with a clear heart... if we manage to restore you, of course.~
@1589 = ~With her death, her coven will be destroyed, and the danger will disappear. Shadow Thieves will take care of the trade routes, I trust. Dishonorable, but better them than her.~
@1590 = ~It is fading. Perhaps it reminds me of my duties, admonishing me for traveling with a Bhaalspawn? Or berates me for abandoning you in Irenicus' hands? I do not know... but I am worried.~
@1591 = ~These are the colors of my House. Purple... the color of existential despair. How ironic that I should be wearing them. But fitting, I admit.~
@1592 = ~What for? To participate in a massive slaughtering campaign? In *another* massive slaughtering campaign? To be devoured by my own blade for assisting a Bhaalspawn in bringing death and destruction? And you will bring it, <CHARNAME>. It was prophesied, and it will come to be. But I want no part of it.~
@1593 = ~For now, we share a common goal, and your life is in danger. I shall help you, as I swore I would. But beyond this point, you are on your own.~
@1594 = ~Time will tell, <CHARNAME>.~
@1595 = ~Till death do us part, as I told you once.~
@1596 = ~Many things. A moonblade is not as benevolent to its wielder as you probably think. On the contrary, it requires sacrifices... and some of these I am not ready to commit.~
@1597 = ~It was Corellon's plan, originally; Corellon, whom I revere. It led to the deaths of many, and many were left unable to pass onto Arvandor for many years after their natural time. So is my father; so shall I.~
@1598 = ~Threescore of blades were forged, long before Myth Drannor was even founded. Every blade sought particular traits in a would-be wielder. Those whom the blade found unworthy were weakened or killed on the spot. Surprisingly, one of my blood survived and brought a living moonblade home.~
@1599 = ~More surprisingly still, the blade did not die or become dormant. Over the centuries, it grew powerful with the strength of its wielders. Every man foolish enough to claim the blade had to surrender his spirit to it, giving it a new power, but denying himself the final journey to Arvandor for as long as the blade lived. No woman of my clan ever held the blade, for no man would wish such a fate on his wife or daughter.~
@1600 = ~And another thing I feel I should remind you of. Should a moonblade wielder become separated from their sword, they will weaken. If they remain separated for days, the wielder will die.~
@1601 = ~You are an elf, you should know. Our ways and traditions are the same for every elf, moon, green or golden. Oh, there are superstitions and foolish ambitions, but you encounter those in every race.~
@1602 = ~Our way is simple, as is nearly everything about elves - for an elf, of course. No elf shall do intentional harm to another elf, and except in a case where an elf acts with malicious intent, he shall be helped by other elves. When I was younger, I was eager to change the word "elf" to "being of sentient race", but having encountered orcs, drow, and in some cases - humans and breed, I do not trust strangers of other races any longer.~
@1603 = ~As for moon elves themselves... the ruling family of Evermeet is Moon Elven, and our Queen holds a living moonblade, as I do. If you ever find yourself in Evereska or upon Evermeet, you will be surrounded by my kin, but in truth, you may find them anywhere. We are wanderers, even myself, much as I deny it sometimes.~
@1604 = ~I am older than you, but still far from old, by our standards. "The prime of life," they call it. Ironic, for I do not feel particularly powerful or vigorous. Doomed, if anything.~
@1605 = ~About my devotion to magic you already know; so do you about my allegiance to the Greycloaks, I am sure. I doubt you will understand my outlook, though: your very nature is chaotic, while I put my trust in destiny and duty.~
@1606 = ~This is all I have to say, I am afraid. I have no friends; I will never start a family; my life is forfeit. Shall we go?~
@1607 = ~I've nothing else to hide from you. You know every little thing.~
@1608 = ~Such as?~
@1609 = ~No, I don't.~
@1610 = ~Humor me.~
@1611 = ~Never mind, then.~
@1612 = ~You might have noticed that I wince every time you plunge into battle...~
@1613 = ~Yes, I have. And that you sigh every time we get a new good-looking male party member.~
@1614 = ~And another habit of rubbing your temples when you study a particularly difficult spell...~
@1615 = ~And that you whisper my name every time you fall into reverie...~
@1616 = ~No, I haven't. Anything else?~
@1617 = ~I see. Never mind, then.~
@1618 = ~Oh, yes, you do.~
@1619 = ~I told you.~
@1620 = ~I use my left hand as I write...~
@1621 = ~But the right one as you eat. You were wincing horribly over the last dinner, by the way.~
@1622 = ~You have a strand of grey hair near your left temple...~
@1623 = ~You squint at me every time you think I am not looking...~
@1624 = ~You have a tiresome habit of talking me to death every night...~
@1625 = ~You have marvelously soft hands...~
@1626 = ~You know all my favorite phrases...~
@1627 = ~TRUST ME, I DO!~
@1628 = ~Oh, yes. I go to bed with "We're all doomed" ringing in my ears, be sure about that.~
@1629 = ~Oh? And what would those be? Not "Life is so hollow", by chance?~
@1630 = ~And you have a wonderful voice.~
@1631 = ~...and, I believe, all my faults.~
@1632 = ~Yes, you have no sense of humor. Or do you?~
@1633 = ~When something is not to your liking, you complain endlessly.~
@1634 = ~You always, always insist on protecting me, even if it's completely unnecessary.~
@1635 = ~You talk twice as much as my other companions.~
@1636 = ~I do not know whether it is a fault, but you love me.~
@1637 = ~Indeed, I know you well. Shall we go?~
@1638 = ~I do. And I cannot spend a single day without you...~
@1639 = ~Not that I am complaining, mind you. My own pleasure slave, and a damn good kisser, at that...~
@1640 = ~But you fear that despite our bond, one day, I will cast you out...~
@1641 = ~And losing me is your greatest fear...~
@1642 = ~And you secretly compare me to your moonblade, since you are bound to both...~
@1643 = ~Yes, I know. You won. Shall we go now?~
@1644 = ~You do know more than you show, don't you? Oh, and I also have no inclination to dance, drink or sing whatsoever.~
@1645 = ~And no scars, tattoos or body paint whatsoever. Mmm...~
@1646 = ~And your eyes darken to black every time you hold me... it feels sooo nice...~
@1647 = ~Oh, but when we are alone, do we even have time to dance or sing? No... quite the contrary, in fact...~
@1648 = ~You are such a bore.~
@1649 = ~Neither do I, so never mind.~
@1650 = ~Yes, yes. Enough of this.~
@1651 = ~Now, do you see that you know everything there is?~
@1652 = ~I do. I know you well.~
@1653 = ~There are things to be discovered, still.~
@1654 = ~No. Lovers we are, but strangers, as well.~
@1655 = ~<CHARNAME>! Are you... what on Faerun are you thinking about? Are you even listening?~
@1656 = ~Hmm?~
@1657 = ~Yes?~
@1658 = ~...what?~
@1659 = ~Ah, you are still here, then.~
@1660 = ~Yes, I am! A girl has a right to dream a little!~
@1661 = ~Where else would I be? Listening to you, oh Wordy One.~
@1662 = ~Oh, yes. As are you. Very much here...~
@1663 = ~And I know you. Every bit of you, every strand of your hair, every expression of your eyes... but I am drifting away when you need my magic. Shall we go? Or would you prefer... to call a halt right now?~
@1664 = ~Oh? I must say, it sounds promising. But time, alas, grows short. Shall we go? Or would you prefer... to call a halt right now?~
@1665 = ~But of course. We have known each other for barely a year. But this knowledge will come to you. It will.~
@1666 = ~Ah, so you are interested now. However, I recall you telling me - and rather explicitly so - to shut up. Or was it "keep your thoughts to yourself"? Regardless, I believe that recounting my biography to you is one of the most pointless things I can do at the moment.~
@1667 = ~There is almost nothing to tell. I prefer not to speak of the dead, and the living are far away. I would rather change the subject, if you will.~
@1668 = ~But if you insist...~
@1669 = ~No. No. I am sorry, <CHARNAME>... but no.~
@1670 = ~Why? What is the point? You will never see it, and I will never return. It was cruel of you to remind me... but you asked, and I shall answer.~
@1671 = ~Evereska is the largest elven settlement on the mainland. It is also the most beautiful one. I remember my first sight of it: I saw Corellon's temple from my mother's chamber. I have seen nothing as amazing ever since. Parks, temples, forests, waterfalls - and above all, peace and safety. An illusion, of course, but such an alluring illusion...~
@1672 = ~But I ramble. Yes, I am loyal to my city and will protect it to the last. As to your question, it holds many secrets, of which it is unwise to speak here. This is all.~
@1673 = ~If the thought of growing old bothers you, you needn't worry.~
@1674 = ~Oh, your strict and admirable moral code is working out quite well for other people.~
@1675 = ~Your enemies.~
@1676 = ~I am certain I will survive until tomorrow, and this is something.~
@1677 = ~Death isn't simply eyeing our group - she is ogling it. All due to your powerful and wise guidance, of course.~
@1678 = ~We are doomed.~
@1679 = ~Me? Actually, I would be interested as to why you have chosen the Art. But very well.~
@1680 = ~Magic runs in my family. It is art and craft and song. It allows you to heal minds and ward off danger, as well as create true wonders. Simple fireballs and acid are not worth it.~
@1681 = ~If only we had time, I would have shown you the advanced magic of runes, nimble fingerwork and subtle steams, but, alas, we have none. We shall have to make do with primitive enchantments for now... though, given your lineage, it is just as well.~
@1682 = ~There is not much to tell, I am afraid. I rented a room in that slimy den they call the Copper Coronet, fell into reverie... and this is all. When I came awake, nearly all my things were gone, my moonblade lay on the floor splattered with blood, and there was no indication whatsoever of the suspect.~
@1683 = ~Of course, the owner was leery to start an investigation, so I had to leave and register a complaint over at the Council of Six building - and I met you. The rest you know.~
@1684 = ~Nothing, or nearly nothing. Despite reason, I continue traveling with you, Child of Bhaal, so I deserve this fear. I will feel Corellon's ire soon, I am sure.~
@1685 = ~(shudder) No. Never. I am bound to you, mortal and divine both. To you, not to this monster. Irenicus drained you of your divinity, but not of our connection - though it is doomed to fade, in time.~
@1686 = ~However... yes. I have started to see visions... waking dreams... memories that are neither mine nor yours. They are repulsive, but there is something else. Something... something that implies that Irenicus is not a monster... *was* not a monster. He was high among their ranks... he was one of - ~
@1687 = ~No. It is surely impossible. I am tired, rest-deprived - I am not able to think clearly. Irenicus killed many, and is going to kill many more. Let us find and stop him, while we still can.~
@1688 = ~But of course. What is it?~
@1689 = ~I do not know what to do about my nightmares. It is unbearable.~
@1690 = ~I wonder, what should I do with Irenicus, once I find him?~
@1691 = ~Making decisions is difficult. Sometimes I think I grew up too fast...~
@1692 = ~Do you ever think about just saying "to the Nine Hells with it all"?~
@1693 = ~Um... have you heard of these events in Riatavin?~
@1694 = ~Tell me, what do you do at nights when we are staying at an inn?~
@1695 = ~I miss normal life so... You have no idea.~
@1696 = ~Do you ever dream?~
@1697 = ~I think I am in love...~
@1698 = ~Xan, your cooking...~
@1699 = ~May I talk to you? About Imoen?~
@1700 = ~My soul... it's so damn empty!~
@1701 = ~What do I do with my taint now? It is getting stronger...~
@1702 = ~Praise the gods, we are in the world of the living again!~
@1703 = ~When I look at our equipment, I want to sing.~
@1704 = ~Do you ever dream of an ideal woman?~
@1705 = ~What were you like as a child? I am curious.~
@1706 = ~Do you ever become jealous of me?~
@1707 = ~What was the happiest moment of your life?~
@1708 = ~There was sorrow in your life, I know. Will you share it with me?~
@1709 = ~Tell me of your journey from Baldur's Gate to Evereska.~
@1710 = ~You used to have nightmares... and visions. What is it you see now?~
@1711 = ~Nothing. I simply want to tell you how much I love you.~
@1712 = ~I am still angry over your betrayal, and this anger simply won't go away.~
@1713 = ~Speaking of titles and money, are you a prince swimming in riches or a plain, penniless mage? I've never asked, but I am curious.~
@1714 = ~Why did you call me your friend in the talk with Elhan?~
@1715 = ~We have so very little time left. You are fleeting through my fingers...~
@1716 = ~I do not wish to face Irenicus. I want to run away, never to return.~
@1717 = ~You miss Evereska, Greycloaks and your former life, don't you? How bad is it?~
@1718 = ~I've been thinking... do you want a child?~
@1719 = ~Aren't you tired of your Greycloak duties? Don't you want to be free?~
@1720 = ~Hey, head up! I say you will survive, and don't you trust me by now?~
@1721 = ~Did you miss me through all this time?~
@1722 = ~Is there anything you desire with all your heart?~
@1723 = ~You are always so calm... Do you ever get angry at all?~
@1724 = ~You are looking through me again. What is it you see?~
@1725 = ~Do you keep a journal?~
@1726 = ~Life has a point: to love others. Don't you agree?~
@1727 = ~You'll protect me, won't you?~
@1728 = ~I think that I might be in love with you, Xan.~
@1729 = ~Let's have a drink and make love tonight, for tomorrow we may be dead.~
@1730 = ~I hate you! It was not enough that Irenicus has taken my spirit, not enough that I was forced to turn into a horrible monster, but you had to abandon me, as well!~
@1731 = ~You abandoned me so easily that I started to wonder: did you love me at all?~
@1732 = ~Xan, we face such dangerous tasks that I have to ask: you are not with me in love... but will you be with me in death?~
@1733 = ~It has been a long time since that Slayer transformation, and I have stayed myself ever since. Gives some food for thought, don't you think?~
@1734 = ~I have qualms about our current employer, to be honest.~
@1735 = ~I have qualms about our current employer, to be honest.~
@1736 = ~Captured, and kept underwater! I cannot believe it!~
@1737 = ~So, Irenicus is an elf. Like you. Like me.~
@1738 = ~We are to part soon, aren't we?~
@1739 = ~Such a mysterious place, this Watcher's Keep. Have you heard of it before?~
@1740 = ~Xan, I like you very much, but, please, stop flirting with me.~
@1741 = ~Xan, if you wish to flirt with me again, you may do so.~
@1742 = ~We could not form a relationship, but can we still be friends?~
@1743 = ~Don't you like me? Not as a friend, but a woman?~
@1744 = ~I am sorry for offending you. Can we be... more than friends again?~
@1745 = ~Xan, I enjoy your affection, but I cannot return it.~
@1746 = ~Won't you change your mind about breaking up with me?~
@1747 = ~Can we... break our bond? End our relationship?~
@1748 = ~I am sorry for being rude. I am in the mood to talk again, if you are interested.~
@1749 = ~You talk too much. I would rather that you kept quiet for some time.~
@1750 = ~As you desire.~
@1751 = ~Indeed?~
@1752 = ~(Xan catches your palm and kisses it.)~
@1753 = ~Thank you, <CHARNAME>.~
@1754 = ~No, <CHARNAME>. I would never be able to look at you as a friend and only a friend. We are better off as we are, and, perhaps, it is for the best.~
@1755 = ~You are a jewel among the People, it's true. But since the first fact I learned about you was the name of your divine father... no. The man who will commit himself to you must be a brave man indeed.~
@1756 = ~Er...~
@1757 = ~No offfense meant, but no. Excuse me.~
@1758 = ~More than friends, you say?~
@1759 = ~No. Irenicus awaits, and you need your focus. You need strength, and I cannot let you draw on mine: I do not have any.~
@1760 = ~Besides, you are... what you are. I cannot pretend that I am not afraid of you. I am sorry.~
@1761 = ~<CHARNAME>, I see that you do not love me. Why ask? Look somewhere else, if you will.~
@1762 = ~I do not want to look anywhere else. I want you.~
@1763 = ~It was a mistake to approach you, I see.~
@1764 = ~I am sorry, Xan. I will leave you alone.~
@1765 = ~What for? (sigh) But I cannot resist you. I cannot...~
@1766 = ~It was. I wish you happiness... but please, stop asking me this.~
@1767 = ~Thank you... I suppose.~
@1768 = ~Thank you... for being honest.~
@1769 = ~You know the answer, <CHARNAME>. I am sorry.~
@1770 = ~You may do so by sending me away. But ask yourself: do you truly wish to?~
@1771 = ~Very well, I'll keep it in mind.~
@1772 = ~A Bhaalspawn, and a fine example of bad manners, at that.~
@1773 = ~Neither do I, for that matter. You have my sympathy, but it hardly helps.~
@1774 = ~It doesn't. What can I do?~
@1775 = ~It does. It was all I wanted in the first place.~
@1776 = ~I cannot even talk of them with anyone!~
@1777 = ~Never mind. Let us continue on.~
@1778 = ~As you wish.~
@1779 = ~You can only be saved from fire by fire. Tell me, if you want to. You will have to relive it again, but it will be less horrible than keeping it inside.~
@1780 = ~Everyone I approached turned into stone and shattered, ending with Imoen. Finally, Irenicus appeared and asked me if I knew what I wanted.~
@1781 = ~I had a choice between accepting the power Irenicus promised, and raining fire from the sky, or refusing it.~
@1782 = ~Irenicus showed me how fragile I was, and how magnificent I could become if I used the powers I possessed.~
@1783 = ~No, no. I do not want to talk about it with anyone.~
@1784 = ~Tell *you* anything? Ha! Just go away!~
@1785 = ~Then you have it. (sigh) It is horrible when rest ceases to be a refuge.~
@1786 = ~Why are you intent on being this rude? (sigh) Never mind. I shall not bother you again.~
@1787 = ~What did you say? Did you accept his proposal?~
@1788 = ~Of course I did!~
@1789 = ~Of course I did not!~
@1790 = ~I do not know. For some strange reason, it seems that Irenicus has not been totally honest with me.~
@1791 = ~He did not propose anything. He only promised.~
@1792 = ~I am not going to tell you anything!~
@1793 = ~Then we are going to live in interesting times indeed. (sigh) Lead on.~
@1794 = ~Ah, I see. Vigilance. Yes, there's the easy way, the hard way, and your way, which makes the hard way look easy.~
@1795 = ~(sigh) Nothing good will come of this, I can just see it.~
@1796 = ~Indeed? Why, yes, it would be just a little bit strange if he was to be trusted all of a sudden. (sigh) Well, if your wit is alive and thriving, then, perhaps, things are not as bad for you as they seem, no?~
@1797 = ~I imagine he would. What for, though? Is it a trap of sorts? I wonder... but I cannot help you. You'll have to decide for yourself.~
@1798 = ~Suit yourself.~
@1799 = ~What indeed? Saying a quick prayer is my suggestion.~
@1800 = ~No, no. My thoughts were more like "kill him quickly", "burn him slowly", or "put him in a cage and cast Insect Plague".~
@1801 = ~You do not accept the possibility that I will win, do you?~
@1802 = ~(sigh) Indeed.~
@1803 = ~(sigh) <CHARNAME>, you remain impervious to reason, sense, and change.~
@1804 = ~You are doomed. You - are - doomed. It is too late to salvage your ruined dreams, it is too late to unsquander your wasted potential, and, as of several months ago, it is too late to hide your wretched heritage. Irenicus will merely finish what Bhaal has begun.~
@1805 = ~Ye gods! I am just SO TIRED OF YOUR CONSTANT DOOMSAYING!~
@1806 = ~Yes, yes. Death will come as blessed release, and... (yawn)~
@1807 = ~Nah. Wait and see.~
@1808 = ~I will delay this moment however possible, then.~
@1809 = ~Your constant shouting is none the better.~
@1810 = ~Dismiss my words as you wish. You have talent to burn, however... and you will.~
@1811 = ~I am ever waiting for death. I might as well include another possibility into the list, I suppose.~
@1812 = ~Try, but you will fail. We all shall.~
@1813 = ~Would you prefer to stay an eternal child, like this foster sister of yours? We all do what we have to, regardless of our desires. In fact... I barely remember the last time I did something because I wanted to.~
@1814 = ~It is the same with me. Ever since Gorion died...~
@1815 = ~It has always been the same with me. Bullied at Candlekeep, hunted on the road, tortured and manipulated here...~
@1816 = ~I am not that miserable, fortunately. But I am tired of duty and responsibility.~
@1817 = ~To become like Imoen? I think I prefer to leave things as they are, thank you very much!~
@1818 = ~An eternal child, like Imoen? What a wonderful idea!~
@1819 = ~Yes, you never had a proper childhood, and now your youth is tainted, as well. Not to mention that you will never reach the old age... but I digress from the original discussion.~
@1820 = ~I recall that she was rather irresponsible. But loyal, I admit. Anyway...~
@1821 = ~I live with this regret, too. Ticking off days, watching the sand in the hourglass, counting months and years and wishing the time would go back - it is pointless, <CHARNAME>. Totally and utterly pointless.~
@1822 = ~I suppose so. Still, I have regrets.~
@1823 = ~Things are easier for you. You are the follower; I am the one making difficult decisions.~
@1824 = ~Why do you have to turn every conversation inside out so its primary topic is death?~
@1825 = ~(sigh) Who doesn't?~
@1826 = ~Do you expect a Child of Bhaal to be a mere member of some adventuring party? It is impossible. Your blood calls, and you will rule, willingly or not. Obviously, you will die before you are able to control anything significant, but still, the follower's role is not for you.~
@1827 = ~Because our lives are about to end. It is, you will find, a common occurrence that lives tend to end in death. Try to watch your enemies some time.~
@1828 = ~It is a dangerous thing to desire. With my art, I should be doubly cautious: emotions woven into a spell are disastrous. No, <CHARNAME>, I am trying hard not to. What of you?~
@1829 = ~Every day.~
@1830 = ~Sometimes, but not often.~
@1831 = ~Never.~
@1832 = ~Not really. I am much more at ease with sending others to the Nine Hells.~
@1833 = ~But there is no escape, is there?~
@1834 = ~(sigh) Don't we all?~
@1835 = ~Indeed? Your self-restraint is admirable, then.~
@1836 = ~I should have guessed.~
@1837 = ~I wish our lives were more peaceful. Seven battles a day as opposed to twelve would be a welcome release. But I would rather try to control the events than drift with the current. Not that anything depends on my opinion, of course.~
@1838 = ~True. I am the leader, and I shall listen to no one!~
@1839 = ~I cannot maintain it, however I try. I keep being thrown from one place to another, and it never ends.~
@1840 = ~Ah, what is the point? We are doomed, control or no control!~
@1841 = ~I will try, Xan. I do not know how I am going to succeed, but I will try.~
@1842 = ~(snort) When you become a line in historical manuscripts, you will only be remembered as a footnote, and an exceptionally gruesome one, at that.~
@1843 = ~Yes, your divine part is steering you somewhere, and it cannot end well. But you may try. It will only prolong the agony, I am sure, but anything is better than becoming a pile of dust, is it not?~
@1844 = ~<CHARNAME>, when will you stop copying me?~
@1845 = ~No. Even if you could, you wouldn't. I already feel it: your divine part is steering you somewhere... and it cannot end well.~
@1846 = ~What? You are not just keeping the conversation going, are you?~
@1847 = ~Yes, of course. Why?~
@1848 = ~No, I honestly want to know your opinion.~
@1849 = ~Who, me?~
@1850 = ~Yes, you.~
@1851 = ~Small talk will not help us survive. Besides, I am not interested in human affairs: I spend a tenday among the scrolls and maps before departing for my missions, but not more. I am as ignorant in politics as a simple farmer, I'm afraid. Speak to someone else, if you will.~
@1852 = ~Very well, I'll do just that.~
@1853 = ~Why are you so... unsociable?~
@1854 = ~A pity.~
@1855 = ~Thank you.~
@1856 = ~(sigh) <CHARNAME>, my nerves are strained to the extreme, I am trying to concentrate on our hopeless task - what is the point in these interruptions? I would understand if you needed help, but since you are talking joyously, instead of gulping one healing potion after another, you do not.~
@1857 = ~So, forgive me, but I am not ready to indulge you just yet.~
@1858 = ~Of course. Take your time. And, by the way, our task is not hopeless.~
@1859 = ~Certainly, Xan. You should have said something earlier. I would understand.~
@1860 = ~Be quiet, then! There's no need to make speeches about how you need silence.~
@1861 = ~Bah! As if I wanted to talk to you in the first place!~
@1862 = ~Of course, of course. You will not hear a word.~
@1863 = ~Oh. Quite a question, I see. Just what exactly do you want to know?~
@1864 = ~Well, you can't be sitting in your room with a spellbook all the time, can you?~
@1865 = ~Everything! Do you meet someone, or go to the main room, or stay alone, or - ~
@1866 = ~Well, there were rumors...~
@1867 = ~Nothing. Forget I asked.~
@1868 = ~There was nothing interesting to reveal, in any case. But as you wish.~
@1869 = ~<CHARNAME>, I do not know what exactly you have heard, but I indeed spend my time in a room with a spellbook - if I am fortunate enough to get a room all to myself, that is. There are no drunken orgies, no late night celebrations, and no - how should I put it? - temporary companions. I hope that your curiosity is satisfied now.~
@1870 = ~A shame. I thought more of you.~
@1871 = ~Yes, I am relieved now.~
@1872 = ~I wondered what you were doing behind my back... and I still wonder.~
@1873 = ~I do not think that you have told me everything.~
@1874 = ~Well, now you will have to live with the truth. But the truth is never particularly interesting, is it?~
@1875 = ~Thank the Seldarine for that.~
@1876 = ~Do you think that I am insincere? It is your choice. But rest assured, I do keep out of my companions' private life, unlike a certain Bhaalspawn does.~
@1877 = ~Now, all said and done, shall we go?~
@1878 = ~Why, I do. But it is irrelevant, as neither of us will have it again.~
@1879 = ~...since we are doomed to die adventuring.~
@1880 = ~I remember, too. Back in Candlekeep, life was more or less normal.~
@1881 = ~It was normal for me, before I have learned who I am. What I am.~
@1882 = ~Exactly. Why, have I told you this already?~
@1883 = ~But Gorion knew, and so did the senior monks, I am sure. There must have been some suspicion, even if you do not remember.~
@1884 = ~Even if you had a chance for normal life, your heritage drowned it outright. But you are still allowed to have brief respites, calm conversations, companions, who do not rush to kill you on sight... though there are fewer and fewer of the latter.~
@1885 = ~Indeed.~
@1886 = ~Don't you, yourself, want a calmer, quieter life?~
@1887 = ~I know that adventuring is not without its advantages, but I want more than this. I want a home.~
@1888 = ~And we just had such a brief respite. Let's go!~
@1889 = ~I do, but apart from my Greycloak duties, who would have me? No one, and then what will I do in an empty house, alone?~
@1890 = ~No, it is as pointless as our fruitless wandering. At least, here I will die for a purpose.~
@1891 = ~It is far too dangerous for you to settle down, and you know it. Cyricists will hunt you, mobs will burn your property, bounty hunters will ambush you, and your skills will be of no use. And, of course, there is your hungry sire and the words of Alaundo.~
@1892 = ~(sigh) Our liaison with danger continues, doesn't it?~
@1893 = ~Come, <CHARNAME>. It is futile to talk of this further.~
@1894 = ~Yes. Come, <CHARNAME>. It is futile to talk of this further.~
@1895 = ~Everybody does. Why should I be an exception?~
@1896 = ~Because you're all doom and gloom, and never large pink bubbles!~
@1897 = ~I know that you are not, but I am curious what your dreams are about.~
@1898 = ~You do not look like a dreamer to me, that is all.~
@1899 = ~Wh-what?~
@1900 = ~You need to relax sometimes, that's what I'm saying!~
@1901 = ~With sugar on top!~
@1902 = ~Never mind. So, what are you dreaming of?~
@1903 = ~Ah. A... a relief, I suppose.~
@1904 = ~I think that someone here has had *too* much sugar, and it is definitely not me.~
@1905 = ~I rarely dream. If I did, I do not think I would have the heart to wake up every morning. But when I do, I see Evereska. Mountains and waterfalls... I will never see them again...~
@1906 = ~I miss Candlekeep, too. It was my home for so long...~
@1907 = ~Big deal. I'll never see Candlekeep, and I'm all the happier for it.~
@1908 = ~Why would you want to? You've seen more interesting places with me.~
@1909 = ~I usually dream of other things.~
@1910 = ~(sigh) A petty and pathetic sight we must be, with these primitive sorrows. At first, I thought it would pass, but while time heals all wounds, it seems to heal mine in reverse.~
@1911 = ~This is because you were raised among humans. Were you raised among the People, you'd feel this longing. Even if we are wanderers, we must have home... and hope.~
@1912 = ~What were these, I wonder? Dungeons? Long and dusty roads? Ah, how could I have forgotten! Sewers, of course.~
@1913 = ~But of course. Every day, your tiny, subconscious acts of self-destruction grow a little more effective. Soon, you will doom us all with your so-called 'dreams'.~
@1914 = ~Let us go, <CHARNAME>. I have no desire to speak of it further.~
@1915 = ~Seldarine, this is the last straw! A Child of Bhaal is bad enough, but a Child of Bhaal in love! We are doomed.~
@1916 = ~Oh, but I am doomed by love! What better doom could there be?~
@1917 = ~On the contrary, I have never felt so safe, so protected...~
@1918 = ~Do you advise me to abandon my lover, then?~
@1919 = ~I shouldn't have told you. Never mind.~
@1920 = ~Me, to advise you? Even if I did, would you follow my advice?~
@1921 = ~It is too late, I'm afraid. I will spend all night wondering how your passion is going to decrease our meager chances for survival. But you hardly care.~
@1922 = ~As I thought. <CHARNAME>, do you have a single grain of reason in this impassioned head of yours?~
@1923 = ~I do. Being in love does not mean being stripped of reason.~
@1924 = ~More than you, I am sure.~
@1925 = ~Reason? What is it?~
@1926 = ~Reason, my poor friend, is the wisdom that says: "Bereft of love, you will live forever." Sadly, it says nothing on the subject of love itself.~
@1927 = ~Wait... it does. A stale banality, but true: "Love is a venom which knows no cure." I presume the sages did not bother to construct anything original, since those who love do not live long enough to consult a scroll.~
@1928 = ~Me?~
@1929 = ~Honestly, I will live longer than you because of this reason alone.~
@1930 = ~No, no. We will die together, haven't you forgotten?~
@1931 = ~Bah! Nobody loves you, that's why you are so bitter.~
@1932 = ~Maybe. But will you be happier than me?~
@1933 = ~Let's finish this discussion. We obviously have different views.~
@1934 = ~Oh, but you will not be able to fully appreciate the tragic irony: you'll be on fire.~
@1935 = ~I am hardly able to live with myself sometimes, let alone love. Should I expect this from anyone else? I think not.~
@1936 = ~I will not, but neither will it end well with you. You will always hurt the ones you love - but then, you always hurt everyone.~
@1937 = ~I wish luck to you, but I know you will have none.~
@1938 = ~We do, and yours will doom us yet. Good luck to you, <CHARNAME>. You will need it.~
@1939 = ~Good luck to you, <CHARNAME>. You will need it.~
@1940 = ~What of it?~
@1941 = ~It is very good. So good, in fact, that I think you should do it every day.~
@1942 = ~Do you really eat this vegetable slush?!~
@1943 = ~It is... passable.~
@1944 = ~It is abysmal! If you ever make anything like this again, consider yourself doomed!~
@1945 = ~Ah... I am flattered, but I would rather busy myself with my spellbook, if it is the same to you.~
@1946 = ~What exactly is wrong with it? Do you prefer heavily spiced meat, like Thayvian barbarians do? No, thank you.~
@1947 = ~In this case, you will excuse me if I pass this honor to others. I would not dream of... accidentally... poisoning you.~
@1948 = ~As for your own cooking...~
@1949 = ~What, didn't you like it?~
@1950 = ~It is way better than yours!~
@1951 = ~Try to say anything about my cooking, and you'll become our next meal!~
@1952 = ~...I will pass the judgment for now. I believe that evaluating a Bhaalspawn's culinary abilities is not extremely healthy, is it?~
@1953 = ~Do you miss the girl?~
@1954 = ~I do. She was so important for me, you have no idea.~
@1955 = ~I dislike her, but I would never abandon her to Irenicus.~
@1956 = ~Not as such. But I feel guilty. I should have protected her somehow, I know.~
@1957 = ~No, and neither do I want to save her! It is not fair!~
@1958 = ~Gods, no! She may die for all I care!~
@1959 = ~(sigh) I know, and I am sorry. I, too, lost... not friends as such, but valued companions. Some deaths were especially hard to bear. I hope you will not suffer the same.~
@1960 = ~I do not doubt you. Indeed, I would not abandon my worst enemy to Irenicus, if I had one. Judging by your few words, the man is a raving lunatic, and a cunning one, at that.~
@1961 = ~I know this feeling. Nothing is as painful - and as pointless. Guilt, revenge, frustration - and you cannot change anything, cannot bring the dead back.~
@1962 = ~It is your choice and your feelings, of course.~
@1963 = ~Regardless, you will find her soon, dead or alive. But... why was Irenicus so sure you'd follow him? He could not know of your feelings for her, could he?~
@1964 = ~No, and if he did, he would have thought twice. No, there was something else.~
@1965 = ~He could. He tortured both her and me, so one of us must have told him.~
@1966 = ~He probably assumed that she was my best friend, and thought I'd help her, no matter what.~
@1967 = ~Perhaps he had spies at Candlekeep?~
@1968 = ~Perhaps he needed her, not me?~
@1969 = ~Something important...~
@1970 = ~He might have learned it, true...~
@1971 = ~Could he have been so naive? Both of you were obviously important to him. No, he must have conducted some research...~
@1972 = ~Her? Was she a Child of Bhaal? No. You were. She was but a nameless girl from Candlekeep. I doubt she was anything more than a bait... though...~
@1973 = ~Ah, but what is the point in guessing? We will never know, until we find them, and then it will be too late.~
@1974 = ~Come. Perhaps we'll save this damsel yet, even if we find ourselves in distress afterwards.~
@1975 = ~(sigh) As should be expected. Though it was doomed from the very start, wasn't it?~
@1976 = ~Yes, father Bhaal had seen to that.~
@1977 = ~Tainted though it was, it did not nearly come to Irenicus' level.~
@1978 = ~Don't you dare to speak of my soul like that!~
@1979 = ~(sigh) It is the irony of being divine.~
@1980 = ~Yet, you have an advantage. He thought he lured you into his web, a helpless victim. But it was the other way around: you drew him into your wake. Your ways will cross once again, and it is up to you who will be the victor.~
@1981 = ~It is rather optimistic of you.~
@1982 = ~And you'll help me, won't you?~
@1983 = ~I'm afraid you place too much power on my heritage.~
@1984 = ~Naturally.~
@1985 = ~Yes, Irenicus acquired both your venom and his. Before, though... who knows? Irenicus' past is a mystery.~
@1986 = ~Others did, and will, long after you die. It is inevitable. But as you wish.~
@1987 = ~I would think so, too, if not for your many victories. No, <CHARNAME>, you are powerful, even without your soul. Way too powerful...~
@1988 = ~But of course.~
@1989 = ~(sigh) I did not doubt you would say that.~
@1990 = ~(shudder) Do not ask me. I have seen enough, and I do not want this to happen again, this is all I can say.~
@1991 = ~Neither do I, but what do I DO?~
@1992 = ~You are not afraid of the Slayer, are you?~
@1993 = ~Thanks for nothing.~
@1994 = ~Yes, I am, and you should be, too!~
@1995 = ~I cannot advise you anything. How can I? I know nothing of how your taint works. Try to survive, instead. Try to control... ah, but it's no use.~
@1996 = ~I turned into the Slayer against my will. How can I control it?~
@1997 = ~Damn, why did I have to be the one to lose my soul?~
@1998 = ~Thank you... I suppose. Shall we continue our struggle for survival?~
@1999 = ~Yes... I am sorry. Let us go. Perhaps your situation is not hopeless, yet.~
@2000 = ~Seldarine, what have just I said? It *is* hopeless, now, more than ever. Let us go.~
@2001 = ~I do not know, <CHARNAME>. It is up to you. To think of it, nearly everything is.~
@2002 = ~Because you were born to it. I doubt you would ask yourself this question, should you become a god, now, would you? Only tragedies are questioned... victories are not. But enough of this.~
@2003 = ~Our futile struggle for survival, you meant to say? Yes, let us do so.~
@2004 = ~I never thought I could be missing the fresh air so. Praise the gods and our incredible luck  your incredible luck, that is.~
@2005 = ~Luck? Skill, power and courage!~
@2006 = ~Luck, ha! These drow had no chance!~
@2007 = ~Indeed. I thought we'd all die there.~
@2008 = ~Oh, you are impossible! We survived an encounter with a legend, and you are boasting about your battle prowess!~
@2009 = ~I will never return to the Underdark. I have undergone many horrible experiences, but this one outmatches all. Never again.~
@2010 = ~You still haven't seen it all. Wait until your soul is stolen, and then...~
@2011 = ~Why? It was the most incredible month in my life!~
@2012 = ~I have enjoyed the place, actually.~
@2013 = ~Oh, yes. It was horrible.~
@2014 = ~I know. We will try to recover it, but... (sigh)~
@2015 = ~These are likely your last days, so I understand your deluded joy. But it is a poor foundation for hope. We have none.~
@2016 = ~'Horrible' is too mild a word, but I certainly agree.~
@2017 = ~If I may ask one more time... how do you feel?~
@2018 = ~Worse and worse with each hour. I am dying, Xan.~
@2019 = ~I do not feel any change, to be honest. Strange, isn't it?~
@2020 = ~I feel nothing. No love, no hatred, no pain - nothing.~
@2021 = ~I have never felt better! Oh, and more powerful, too.~
@2022 = ~Then it is time to stop this conversation and reach Irenicus before you *do* die. Come, since we are doomed anyway, we may as well die gloriously.~
@2023 = ~(sigh) How droll...~
@2024 = ~No, it is natural. You will discover the change soon, though. I dread the day when you do.~
@2025 = ~(gulp) Worse than death...~
@2026 = ~Is power all you can think of? (sigh) You'll never change... but perhaps it will be your salvation yet.~
@2027 = ~And when I look at you, I want to cry. Honestly, <CHARNAME>, will you remain a child till the end of your days?~
@2028 = ~Bah! Who says that I *will* die?~
@2029 = ~A child or no, I'll be equally dead.~
@2030 = ~Don't be too surprised... but I wouldn't want to die at all!~
@2031 = ~Hmm... yes, the idea has merit. Here, carry my backpack. I need to rehearse a proper, dignified behavior!~
@2032 = ~Do you seriously think that you have a choice?~
@2033 = ~The world watches, they say, so your behavior matters. It is up to you, of course.~
@2034 = ~<CHARNAME>, no - ~
@2035 = ~Concerning equipment, however...~
@2036 = ~No, nothing. (sigh) Never mind. I believe we are fully prepared for a pointless, tedious, and, above all, inevitable defeat.~
@2037 = ~I have seen the Robe of Vecna on display in the back rooms of the Adventurer's Mart, as well as some useful scrolls. They are ridiculously expensive, but they could be of help. What do you think?~
@2038 = ~Interesting. We may have a look at these, if we have the time.~
@2039 = ~I do not think we have enough money. Sorry, Xan.~
@2040 = ~Er... I recall buying it and then disposing of it... hmm...~
@2041 = ~As you see fit. I wish to see Irenicus dead, but my heart keeps telling me that it is impossible with any equipment. I will be glad if you prove me wrong, however.~
@2042 = ~(sigh) Never mind. I believe we are fully prepared for a pointless, tedious, and, above all, inevitable defeat.~
@2043 = ~Are you hoping for a compliment?~
@2044 = ~No, I am simply curious.~
@2045 = ~If I wanted one, I'd look into a mirror.~
@2046 = ~Don't I deserve it?~
@2047 = ~Why dream of perfection, when live beauty overshadows it? Not for long, since it is meant to die, but... but still.~
@2048 = ~But if there was one? What would she be like?~
@2049 = ~Still, every culture has a legend of an ideal woman woven into it.~
@2050 = ~Perhaps, perhaps. It is certainly going to overshadow you tonight.~
@2051 = ~So, my fragile beauty is better than any ideal? Why, I'm flattered.~
@2052 = ~True enough.~
@2053 = ~I dare say you do.~
@2054 = ~I do not know. Hanali, the goddess of love, is but a symbol of beauty, and my mother... my mother was much more than an empty idol. Besides, unlike you, I am not prone to idle dreaming. Or, rather, I was not prone to it... until now.~
@2055 = ~What has changed?~
@2056 = ~I have a feeling that you have an ideal, but are withholding it from me, because I am nothing like it.~
@2057 = ~Because now you have found your ideal, and it is me?~
@2058 = ~A pointless legend, this. But poets are ever unlucky in love. Perhaps that was the reason, no?~
@2059 = ~Fortunately, I am not a poet, and neither am I prone to idle dreaming. Or, rather, I was not prone to it... until now.~
@2060 = ~I have a feeling that you have an ideal, but I am nothing like it.~
@2061 = ~Oh. I am... hoping for it.~
@2062 = ~(sigh) You are seeking compliments in everything, aren't you?~
@2063 = ~You. You are doomed, and I am wishing again and again that you were not.~
@2064 = ~But you are...~
@2065 = ~And you would be utterly and completely wrong.~
@2066 = ~You would have passed me without giving me a second glance, I'm afraid. I usually sat somewhere out in the gardens, with my nose buried in one book or another. Those were the happy days, but hardly interesting enough to you.~
@2067 = ~This is *very* interesting! Do tell!~
@2068 = ~Books - and nothing else?~
@2069 = ~No, I suppose not.~
@2070 = ~I do not know what I should tell you. The "exciting" things - the first reverie, my days at the Academy, the day I became a moonblade wielder, and, later, a Greycloak - they all happened later. And you won't like another story portraying me in an unfavorable light - and there were many of those.~
@2071 = ~A pity it is. Ah well.~
@2072 = ~I would love to. I know that you are not perfect; I would not be with you if you were.~
@2073 = ~Why? Were you clumsy and obtuse all the time?~
@2074 = ~What else should there be? Girls? Frolicking in the gardens? Feasts and songs? There were, but later and rarer than my readings and my magic. (sigh) I probably should admit that I was fully absorbed in the latter.~
@2075 = ~Is there nothing you can tell me?~
@2076 = ~Poor dear.~
@2077 = ~Oooh, girls, feasts and frolicking! Were there orgies, too?~
@2078 = ~(snort) No, <CHARNAME>. You will probably be happy to hear that it never went *that* far.~
@2079 = ~Then you have had your answer.~
@2080 = ~I was... far from perfect. Not clumsy, no, and neither did my intelligence suffer; I dare say I am proud of my ability. But I had no friends. I never needed them. Evereska was a place of wonder; our library was one of the best in the city; I never needed anything else. It was a failure, since no one of the People should be alone, without the sense of communion. I lost much.~
@2081 = ~And that is all? Such a simple thing?~
@2082 = ~I see. Well, now you have me.~
@2083 = ~So did I. I never had my people. Only Gorion.~
@2084 = ~Sharing is the base of our society. Once the elf cannot exist in a community, he is lost. That's why I insisted that you share your reverie with me before, and that's why I keep telling you about the People, as much as I can. I did not value their company before, but now I would give everything to be there again. Everything... except you.~
@2085 = ~You will see Evereska again. Just wait until I take care of - what was his name? Varenicus? - and you will return. You will. I promise.~
@2086 = ~Not all is lost, Xan. We may yet travel there together.~
@2087 = ~I only bring you pain and trouble, I see.~
@2088 = ~Better to be away from your home than not to have one at all.~
@2089 = ~And we both are, more or less, exiles. Which is never a good thing.~
@2090 = ~I know. You were denied communion, and you almost lost yourself.~
@2091 = ~(sigh) No, <CHARNAME>. I will never return.~
@2092 = ~Oh, but it is not your fault. Love is and has always been pain and trouble. I do not believe in happy endings... sometimes I think that they simply do not exist.~
@2093 = ~I am not complaining, <CHARNAME>. But longing will stay, whether I want it or not.~
@2094 = ~Do you want an honest answer? Ah, but of course you do. Well... a part of me knows that it is a pointless, unpleasant feeling, and trusts you more than I trust myself. However... the rest of me... sometimes... does not.~
@2095 = ~So, you DO get jealous!~
@2096 = ~I knew it, I knew it!~
@2097 = ~But we are so close to each other... why?~
@2098 = ~<CHARNAME>... little one... why the eagerness? Do you enjoy lengthy displays of jealousy and spite?~
@2099 = ~No, but I am very, very curious. Why does it happen?~
@2100 = ~They say: "to be jealous of your lover means to truly love."~
@2101 = ~I am jealous of you sometimes, so why wouldn't you be?~
@2102 = ~I would not mind a duel or two in my name.~
@2103 = ~It is hard to believe in a miracle. You are so close to me, and so important, that I cannot help it sometimes.~
@2104 = ~I do not mind. It only proves your love for me.~
@2105 = ~You must stop it! I do not like it at all!~
@2106 = ~Sometimes... sometimes I cannot, either.~
@2107 = ~Strange. I never experienced this, myself.~
@2108 = ~If you say so. I cannot help but think that it is a weakness, however... but then, love is a weakness. (sigh) Whatever.~
@2109 = ~You want to be admired and fought for, I know. You deserve it all, too... it is just that I cannot imagine fighting for you, if you suddenly desire to be with another.~
@2110 = ~But I will die much earlier than this, of course. Come.~
@2111 = ~You control yourself better than me, it is true. Neither do you deserve it. (sigh) I hope you will forgive me this weakness. Or death will cure me, first. Whatever.~
@2112 = ~The happiest moment of my life - apart from meeting you? There were few, but my first... yes, it was the best one.~
@2113 = ~It was a perfect day: clear, cloudless, calm. I stood on the cliff facing the Anauroch desert, prepared to cast my very first spell. My affinity to the Weave was not as strong as it is now, but still, I felt I was certain to succeed.~
@2114 = ~It happened. The back blow stung, but still, I managed to set off the spell, and sunlight burst into the morning - it was a very simple cantrip, you see. It was wonderful and terrible at the same time: waves of magical energy filling the body, the head feeling as if it was about to burst with new sensations, and an almost unbearable ecstasy; I must have passed out at some point.~
@2115 = ~When I came to, the sun had risen. Natural sunlight was filling the valley - the dawn of my first day as a wizard.~
@2116 = ~How poetic.~
@2117 = ~I thought it will be something more interesting than this.~
@2118 = ~Were you performing your first spell alone? Wasn't it dangerous?~
@2119 = ~You know, I felt the same the first time I cast a spell.~
@2120 = ~I never had such a strong reaction to a simple cantrip. Are you special somehow?~
@2121 = ~Was I? Seldarine, I hope not! But enough poetry for one day, don't you think?~
@2122 = ~There has never been anything more than this. The Weave is everything. Without it, our bond would be no more, our minds would suffer from terrible loneliness, there would be no magic and no Arvandor. You will understand some day... I hope.~
@2123 = ~I wanted to do this alone. It was too intimate to let someone else share it, even a teacher or a friend. I have never spoken of it with anyone, except my father. Now you asked, and I trusted you with this.~
@2124 = ~So, we were alike even then. I am so lucky to have you by my side... (sigh) It just cannot last.~
@2125 = ~I am not the toughest of men, <CHARNAME>. I never was. Besides, every mage reacts to the first contact with the Weave differently. I wonder what your reaction was? Divine and arcane interwoven... it must have been amazing. Come, you may tell me as we walk.~
@2126 = ~I am so lucky to have you by my side... (sigh) It just cannot last.~
@2127 = ~You speak as if you know... but you cannot. I never told you how exactly it happened. <CHARNAME>, I will tell you, but it is a long and sad story indeed. Do not listen if you do not want to.~
@2128 = ~I do.~
@2129 = ~I will listen, if you will tell.~
@2130 = ~I'd better not, then. I am sorry, Xan.~
@2131 = ~It is all right... Come, let us go and forget about this altogether.~
@2132 = ~I will.~
@2133 = ~It was a rainy night... why is it always a rainy night? No matter. I sat in my room, reading, when they arrived: a small group of Greycloaks, half-carrying my father with them. I never quite made sense of their words; my head was entirely empty. That he was poisoned, and likely lethally, was what I remembered.~
@2134 = ~There was a healer among them, but he could do nothing. They carried my father to his chambers and retreated to the front hall, leaving me and my mother with him... dying. His eyes widened when we laid him on the bed. He knew that... he would never rise again. He knew.~
@2135 = ~Xan... it is hard for you. Stop.~
@2136 = ~No, do not tell me. I do not want to know.~
@2137 = ~Go on.~
@2138 = ~(remain silent)~
@2139 = ~No, I... can manage, if you can.~
@2140 = ~We tried to talk, but it was useless. He was in too much pain - pain that neither water nor antidote could quench. My mother tried to speak of some... I do not remember... some small, insignificant matters. I simply stood there, a useless statue, and wished there was a ritual of parting for centuries. I could not think of one.~
@2141 = ~It was over in about an hour, as I recall now, but back then I thought those were mere minutes. We talked, once, before the end. I asked him some foolish thing... begged him not to let go. He smiled for the last time and said that he was doomed to die, and I was doomed to live. Doomed to live... my entire life is described by these words. He died shortly afterwards, in her hands.~
@2142 = ~But you will not die in mine, will you?~
@2143 = ~It... it is awful. Stop it, please.~
@2144 = ~I am so sorry for you...~
@2145 = ~Do you feel any easier now?~
@2146 = ~Better this than to see you die, as well. But - no, I will never abandon you willingly, whatever the alternative.~
@2147 = ~It is over, <CHARNAME>. Over.~
@2148 = ~Perhaps I'll sleep sounder at nights, having told you this. My reveries, alas, are never peaceful.~
@2149 = ~I am scared for you. My heart was going out to him, and he died. Now all I have is you. Perhaps my affection is poisonous, and you are meant to die, too?~
@2150 = ~Nonsense!~
@2151 = ~If I am doomed, it is Bhaal's fault, not yours.~
@2152 = ~*Your* affection? What about Irenicus' "tender" treatment?~
@2153 = ~I think that the idea came to you a tiny moment too late.~
@2154 = ~So you say. Perhaps it is indeed nonsense, but the thought burns me more and more often.~
@2155 = ~If only freeing you were possible... But you will always have me, protecting you - or trying to. Remember that.~
@2156 = ~He will pay for this. You will never be at his mercy again. Never, for as long as I live.~
@2157 = ~Yes... my desire to be at your side was stronger than anything, so I was not thinking of the consequences. Now the thought will burn me until I die.~
@2158 = ~I wish your arms could help, but they do not. (sigh) Come, or we'll be late for the next battle again.~
@2159 = ~I wish my arms could ascertain you of this, but I know that they cannot. (sigh) Come, or we'll be late for the next battle.~
@2160 = ~It was uneventful. I am not as skilled in avoiding danger as you are in drawing it, but I reached the Evereskan gates without bloodshed.~
@2161 = ~Really? I am impressed.~
@2162 = ~What did you do once you reached Evereska, then?~
@2163 = ~Just like that? A long and boring journey?~
@2164 = ~Why, thank you. I wish you were there, as well...~
@2165 = ~I am afraid so.~
@2166 = ~I did not linger in the city, as I promised you not to. I had to spend some time at the temple, however. The fever I caught in the Nashkel mines was becoming stronger, and for one dark moment I thought I would never be fit to travel again. But I recovered, so it is not a cause to worry. If we continue resting in dungeons, however, it may increase.~
@2167 = ~Then it will increase, for our adventures may take us anywhere.~
@2168 = ~No. No resting in dungeons, I promise.~
@2169 = ~And you never told me!~
@2170 = ~What about the Greycloaks? Did you resign?~
@2171 = ~Then it will.~
@2172 = ~Do not give rash promises, <CHARNAME>. Your word is worth more than that.~
@2173 = ~You had a small problem of your own. The discovery of your true heritage was a hard blow.~
@2174 = ~You would be surprised, but it had turned out that I became more powerful than but a handful of my Greycloak companions. You would think that they would, at the very least, allow me a temporary leave, wouldn't you? Well, nothing of the kind happened. I was very discreetly asked to investigate the recent events in Amn, and the request was posed by a person you do not say "no" to.~
@2175 = ~And you didn't, I see.~
@2176 = ~But you did.~
@2177 = ~What happened then?~
@2178 = ~I said "no", of course. I have no objections to being doomed at your side, but a vision of you, doomed in my absence, is not welcoming at all.~
@2179 = ~He insisted, however, pointing out that the task would be left at my discretion, and later more of my brethren would look into the matter, if I happened to fail. I agreed in the end, and here we are - paying much more attention to the shadowy world of Athkatla than we should. But my first and only goal is your safety. It always will be.~
@2180 = ~I do not think those words met with much approval in Evereska.~
@2181 = ~Didn't your superiors mind that you were going to travel with me?~
@2182 = ~Thank you. You matter to me, too.~
@2183 = ~I still think you should have refused.~
@2184 = ~<CHARNAME>, you do not think that I was publicly condemned for my liaison with you, or anything so dark and romantic, do you? No, I had been discreet enough not to mention your name at all. Rest at ease.~
@2185 = ~You do not have years and years of following orders behind you, so your attitude is more - should I say, rebellious? No, rather, independent - and charming, of course.~
@2186 = ~Always.~
@2187 = ~Many things, none of them pleasant. Do you wish me to tell you?~
@2188 = ~Please, do.~
@2189 = ~Of course!~
@2190 = ~No, no. I just asked to be sure.~
@2191 = ~Let us finish this conversation, then.~
@2192 = ~I saw my father, once. He was... accusing me of our relationship.~
@2193 = ~Oh dear. Don't you ever have nice, pleasant visions in which the whole population of Evereska blesses our union?~
@2194 = ~What exactly did he say?~
@2195 = ~Before you start accusing anyone, I'd like to remind you that my dreams are, mostly, what they are - vague visions, produced by my tired imagination. Therefore, all the words said are mine and mine alone.~
@2196 = ~There is a dark path in your future. What if you rule the Realm of Murder yourself? The fault will be mine - ours. I do not feel it as such: anything is better than to see you die. But the figures in my dreams do, my long gone parents among them. They demand that I leave you to your fate, or... or stop you.~
@2197 = ~Do you intend to heed their warnings?~
@2198 = ~Well, you can reassure these proverbial 'figures'. I've no intention to fight for my legacy.~
@2199 = ~But you will not stop me if I decide to ascend, will you?~
@2200 = ~That must have been your conscience speaking. Or your moonblade.~
@2201 = ~I thought that since your mother died, she wouldn't be able to blame you for the choice of her would-be daughter-in-law. Now I see that she got you even beyond the grave.~
@2202 = ~Do you want me to? I should think not, and your word matters to me more than anyone's.~
@2203 = ~I doubt they will listen.~
@2204 = ~How? By driving my sword through you? Or begging you on my knees? Neither is very effective, I believe.~
@2205 = ~Oh, no. Were it my moonblade, I would now be dead at your feet. It is semi-sentient, but it does not give warnings or advice. It kills.~
@2206 = ~Do not jest with such things. Ever again.~
@2207 = ~No, I am worried, but my choices are made. I shall stay with you.~
@2208 = ~And it is far more than 'nothing', I assure you.~
@2209 = ~Don't I get to hear the same from you now?~
@2210 = ~"Far from nothing?" Hmph. You just can't expect gratitude from some people.~
@2211 = ~I should hope so.~
@2212 = ~And neither is your love.~
@2213 = ~No, it is truly nothing. We are dooooooooomed...~
@2214 = ~Why? Do you expect me to say the same? (sigh) Were I at Candlekeep now, I would visit your old room and burn every single romance novel. Humans are ever obsessed with taking, and you have inherited this trait.~
@2215 = ~I do not see what is wrong in desiring to hear "I love you, too."~
@2216 = ~Why? What is the difference between humans and elves?~
@2217 = ~But I did not read romance novels!~
@2218 = ~Xan, I was teasing you! Stop sulking!~
@2219 = ~We love and do not expect anything in return, melamin.~
@2220 = ~No? Oh, that is a relief. I would have been in a very awkward situation otherwise.~
@2221 = ~Why?~
@2222 = ~But it is not awkward, so you may stop sulking now.~
@2223 = ~(snicker) I know...~
@2224 = ~<CHARNAME>, I do - not - sulk!~
@2225 = ~Yes, you do!~
@2226 = ~And what are you doing right now, might I ask?~
@2227 = ~All right, you don't. Now, what were we talking about?~
@2228 = ~Oh, but our love is special, is it not?~
@2229 = ~<CHARNAME>, are you doing this on purpose?~
@2230 = ~I was teasing you, of course. You look just like this when you sulk.~
@2231 = ~Hmm... I am not sure. What do you think?~
@2232 = ~No. I am entirely serious.~
@2233 = ~Yes. Undoubtedly - yes.~
@2234 = ~So am I, at most times. But to<DAYNIGHT>, my kindred spirit, won't you allow your all-consuming fires of grief to burn lower?~
@2235 = ~Elven love - if there is even such a term - always comes first, is never obtrusive, and always unconditional. How it is with other races, I know little, but with many, giving and receiving became a trade, a bargain, a cause for negotiation, even. A scary thought. You grew up among humans; I feared you adopted it.~
@2236 = ~No, Xan. I place no conditions on our love.~
@2237 = ~I've never thought of it, but now you've said it, I suppose not.~
@2238 = ~Perhaps... perhaps I did. I feel it, sometimes.~
@2239 = ~Yes, I did. So what? Do you imply that I am wrong, and you are right?~
@2240 = ~I do not care if it is a bargain or a treaty. I just want to be loved.~
@2241 = ~You are one of the People. It will pass: sooner, rather than later.~
@2242 = ~There is no universal 'wrong' and 'right', just as there is no absolute 'good' and 'evil'. We are simply of different opinions, and, strangely, in love.~
@2243 = ~And you will be. Now, tomorrow, and for as long as I live. If you see it as a contract, and I - as an action of my own free will... well, that makes us both the happier.~
@2244 = ~And before you have strangled me in my sleep: yes, I do love you. (sigh) Now I can die in peace, I suppose.~
@2245 = ~I know of only one betrayal: that I left you, and traveled to Evereska, when you were ambushed, and your companions killed. I... (sigh) Come here, and I will tell you.~
@2246 = ~I was worried for you each day, from the early morning to the middle of the night, when I could neither sleep nor reverie. Simple things hurt me most of all: an empty side of my bedroll, the absence of your hand in mine, fresh notes written by your hand when you were no longer there, and above all, slow and tortuous hours of walking by myself. It was unbearable.~
@2247 = ~But painful as it was, it could not become worse. I departed from Evereska with a clear heart: I was to see you again, and the worst was behind me. How wrong I was...~
@2248 = ~One night, I woke up to such pain that I could not breathe. It was worse for you, as I know now, but I did not then, and this uncertainty... this madness was...~
@2249 = ~No, I do not want to upset you again. You suffered enough, and I regret leaving you. I always will, even if we live an impossible century together. Your pain and anger is justified, and I... I can only offer my love in return. Forgive me.~
@2250 = ~It is hard for me. I shall have to think on this.~
@2251 = ~I will. It is easier to forgive you now.~
@2252 = ~So, you suffered, too. Did you feel anything when Irenicus took my soul, then?~
@2253 = ~No, I will resent this forever and ever. Sorry.~
@2254 = ~You will not lose me, if you close your heart. I shall be grateful if you do not, however. Remember this, will you? Please...~
@2255 = ~Yes, a label of a fellow sufferer is somehow less offending than one of a lucky former companion, is it? (sigh) Never mind. I thank you, <CHARNAME>.~
@2256 = ~I do not remember. I came to not long before we met in the maze. I was shocked and empty, but that was all. I am starting to feel it now, however... and I truly wish I had died instead of you.~
@2257 = ~Whether you are serious or not - for all that it is worth, I am sorry.~
@2258 = ~All that is mine is yours. Why do you ask?~
@2259 = ~Well... I *am* curious.~
@2260 = ~Don't you want to tell me?~
@2261 = ~I do not believe in equality. Your noble birth and station matters much to me.~
@2262 = ~I will not love you less, if you turn out to be poor. I simply want to know.~
@2263 = ~Just answer me, already!~
@2264 = ~Ah, so had I been a commoner who became a moonfighter by mistake, I should have trembled in fear. Not particularly benevolent of you... but very well.~
@2265 = ~I was born into a very old family. Not the noblest, or the purest one - there is always some sort of rivalry between Ar'Tel'Quessir, the sun elves, and Teu'Tel'Quessir, the moon elves, the former desiring to be the highest elven nobility in Evereska and upon Evermeet. The Queen of Evermeet is Moon Elven, however, so their dream is not about to happen soon, and neither is their desire to stand above all. Still, Sun Elven nobility challenged our position.~
@2266 = ~I do not remember us being showered with riches, however. I never needed anything, but I could not simply take twenty thousand gold from my bedside table to help you reach Imoen, in case you are curious. Our estate is beautiful, though... you will like it, I am sure.~
@2267 = ~And that, as they say, is that.~
@2268 = ~Bravo! But you should have added something about diamonds. I like diamonds.~
@2269 = ~Hmm... not bad. Not bad at all.~
@2270 = ~And that is all? But what of your family history, your blood relations with the royalty of Evermeet, your last year's income, and - ~
@2271 = ~With your parents gone, and your siblings in Evermeet, is your estate empty now?~
@2272 = ~Thank you. I longed to know that.~
@2273 = ~A point to keep in mind, I see. (sigh) If you'd spent half as much time as I had researching gems and their properties, you would not be so eager now.~
@2274 = ~I am so glad you approve. Now, your curiosity and my ego satisfied, shall we move on?~
@2275 = ~ - the exact color, weight and amount of your family jewelry, and - ~
@2276 = ~(sigh) All right, I'll stop now.~
@2277 = ~No. It has never been empty, and I hope that it stays this way long after I am gone. It is a home to me, not an abandoned pantheon. Perhaps... one day... you and I...~
@2278 = ~(sigh) It's no use.~
@2279 = ~Did you indeed? I am sorry. My heritage seemed so insignificant compared to yours, but it was a mistake to withhold it, of course.~
@2280 = ~Will you... forgive me... tonight? I very much hope that you do.~
@2281 = ~Be quiet.~
@2282 = ~<CHARNAME>, if I called you my love, my wife, my heart and my world, it would only bring another round of interrogation, and I am sure that we would want to avoid that, now, wouldn't we? Besides, I would not like to discuss my personal life with Elhan. I am probably older and born of a higher station. But rest assured, you are much more than my friend. Always.~
@2283 = ~Do I matter this much to you?~
@2284 = ~Are you ashamed of demonstrating our relationship openly? Ashamed of me?~
@2285 = ~Hmph. Very well, you have convinced me... this time.~
@2286 = ~Born of a higher station? And what will that be?~
@2287 = ~But when you took my hand and started to talk about the sky - he could not help but notice then.~
@2288 = ~No, no. He had too much on his mind to notice. (sigh) At least, I hope so.~
@2289 = ~But you know you do.~
@2290 = ~Nonsense, and untrue, as well. You are in danger. Even here, among our kin. They will question everything about you, given the opportunity, and I do not want to drag our relationship into the gutter.~
@2291 = ~Why, thank you so much, melamin. (sigh) I knew I could count on your indulgence.~
@2292 = ~Does it matter? Noble birth, plain, divine...~
@2293 = ~(sigh) It matters, of course. But I do not want to speak about it.~
@2294 = ~It will not always be like that. This time, they were worried, frightened, suspicious. Later, you will be treated with equal wariness, but with less hostility. We will go on, <CHARNAME>. Regardless of all.~
@2295 = ~Promises, promises...~
@2296 = ~I do not believe it. I will remain a stranger and an enemy to them forevermore.~
@2297 = ~Ooooh, optimism! I'll change you yet!~
@2298 = ~Let's go and see it through, shall we?~
@2299 = ~What else do we have?~
@2300 = ~Oh, they will praise you as a saviour of Suldanessellar yet. I promise you this.~
@2301 = ~Perhaps. Perhaps not. (sigh) Death will, in any case. Come, let us go.~
@2302 = ~Of course. What else can I do when you are taking the lead?~
@2303 = ~Perhaps... perhaps we have a year or two, yet. Before my blade claims me, and your heritage devours you.~
@2304 = ~No. You know that it is hopeless.~
@2305 = ~Perhaps. But a year is not a long time at all.~
@2306 = ~I just have this nagging feeling that something bad is going to happen.~
@2307 = ~(sigh) Do you want me to tell you that it is not?~
@2308 = ~Yes. Tell me.~
@2309 = ~No. What for?~
@2310 = ~No, forget this. It was stupid of me.~
@2311 = ~What would be the point? Things will never change.~
@2312 = ~I will not lie to you. I can only comfort you tonight, and hope that we will live to see tomorrow. Not much, is it?~
@2313 = ~No, no. I would fear you if you were fearless, but as it is, I understand you.~
@2314 = ~Indeed. (sigh) Nothing can help us now.~
@2315 = ~No, but it is all we have. A year, if not less.~
@2316 = ~Ah, this one? Oh, it accompanies me each day. When I truly need a warning, however, it is blissfully silent, so I would not trust your intuition just yet.~
@2317 = ~But I am rambling again, and wasting the precious time that is left. I wish I could preserve it... envelop us in a time cocoon of sorts. But no, we have to march on and tick off days in your journal, wondering which one will be the last. I am tired of it... if not for you, I would have gone mad within days. My wonderful you...~
@2318 = ~And you. Shall we go?~
@2319 = ~Perhaps we'll laugh at these days later. You never know how it may turn out.~
@2320 = ~I changed my mind. We should not go on. We should lie down and die.~
@2321 = ~You are rambling again. Stop.~
@2322 = ~Your wish is my command, of course.~
@2323 = ~It will not end well, of this I am certain. But not as soon as you expect it to. We'll walk together yet, if only for a short while.~
@2324 = ~Indeed? I must have heard it somewhere... <CHARNAME>, stop picking up my favorite sayings. One of me is more than enough for the two of us.~
@2325 = ~It is worth dreaming about, I agree. We could buy a house somewhere in Icewind Dale...~
@2326 = ~...or an estate in Baldur's Gate...~
@2327 = ~...or in Athkatla...~
@2328 = ~...or return to Evereska...~
@2329 = ~...or we could travel around the world...~
@2330 = ~...or we could sail to Evermeet...~
@2331 = ~No, I do not care where to go. Running away is enough.~
@2332 = ~If you wish it. I certainly have some fond memories of this city... and you.~
@2333 = ~Why do you like this city so? Its smell eats my skin wherever you go - and you would dream of staying there! But as you wish.~
@2334 = ~If we could, I would take you there. If my home became yours... nothing could make me more content.~
@2335 = ~...and in a year, a legend will be born of our heroic deaths somewhere in the jungles of Chult. Honestly, <CHARNAME>, do you like adventure this much?~
@2336 = ~A sea voyage is dangerous for one of your heritage. Umberlee is a jealous goddess, and there are others, as well.~
@2337 = ~Regardless, you are not alone in your desire. If we could, we would... but we cannot.~
@2338 = ~I know. Thank you for the encouragement, though.~
@2339 = ~It is still nice to dream, isn't it?~
@2340 = ~But I want away so! Can't you open a portal and take us away from here?~
@2341 = ~And thank you. This conversation took my mind off darker things. But enough dreaming for today, don't you think?~
@2342 = ~It is, but if we continue, sooner or later our dreams will take different directions, and what will we do? These are only dreams, but I do not want us to argue over the impossible.~
@2343 = ~No. Our goal is Irenicus, and, until he is destroyed, running away is out of the question. Lead on, <CHARNAME>. Enough dreaming for today.~
@2344 = ~I am not about to die from it, if that is what you mean. Otherwise... yes, it is hard.~
@2345 = ~Do you blame me for it?~
@2346 = ~Xan... I am sorry.~
@2347 = ~Xan... here, let me hold you for a moment.~
@2348 = ~Well, it was your fault all along.~
@2349 = ~No, as I told you time and again. How can I blame you for my decisions? We are one, but our minds are not.~
@2350 = ~Don't be. My missions took up to several years at times. Though every time I had a hope of coming back, and now I do not.~
@2351 = ~Thank you. Amin mela... mel lle.~
@2352 = ~(sigh) This habit of yours of repeating the obvious things...~
@2353 = ~If we return there, however... if you, a Bhaalspawn, are allowed into the city - will you come with me?~
@2354 = ~Why not?~
@2355 = ~If it is important for you, then yes, I will come.~
@2356 = ~No. I do not think I'll come.~
@2357 = ~No, Xan. Your fellow Greycloaks will execute me on the spot.~
@2358 = ~There are so many things I would show you... so many, and so beautiful...~
@2359 = ~Whatever. This wishful thinking is useless. A homeless wanderer I am, and I will remain such until I die. So will you. Why do I keep dreaming?~
@2360 = ~Such are the ways of love...~
@2361 = ~Because you want to.~
@2362 = ~Why do I?~
@2363 = ~It is not as drastic as that. No one will cause you outright harm; rather, they will simply close the city gates.~
@2364 = ~...or some such romantic nonsense.~
@2365 = ~Oh, I want many things. Irenicus' death, for example. But it will not come to be. So why?~
@2366 = ~Because. Kiss me, and let's go.~
@2367 = ~Xan, if everyone dreamt only of possible things, the world would have been a very boring place.~
@2368 = ~Oh, it *will* come to be. Take my word on this.~
@2369 = ~Why indeed?~
@2370 = ~Well, if you insist...~
@2371 = ~It will never become boring. Not with constant wars, pillaging, murder, intrigue and minor squabbles continuing in every house, city and Plane. It is doomed.~
@2372 = ~Ever hopeful, are you?~
@2373 = ~But my musings are not the best way to spend the time. Let us go, before the inevitable happens, and I bore you to tears.~
@2374 = ~A child? You do not know what you are asking for.~
@2375 = ~I know it very well. Do you?~
@2376 = ~What? Is it connected to your moonblade somehow?~
@2377 = ~Well... now you know. Come.~
@2378 = ~Should I remind you again? You will not like it... but so be it.~
@2379 = ~My moonblade is the reason, of course. It passed down the generations with ease, cutting though souls like butter, but it did not ruin families. Each and every time, the future wielder produced offspring before the blade touched his hands. He was unsure he would be chosen, you see, and thus he started a family with a heavy heart, but started it regardless.~
@2380 = ~It is different with me. I was barely older than you when I claimed the blade, and since then, I knew that my son will inherit it, will spend eons after his death imprisoned by Corellon's will. I... I cannot take this. Forgive me... I cannot.~
@2381 = ~But what if it is a daughter?~
@2382 = ~It is not the worst fate. Look at me.~
@2383 = ~Shh... I know. Come, we shall not talk about it further.~
@2384 = ~This is a relief, actually. I do not want children, and now I know that you don't, too.~
@2385 = ~A daughter is impossible.~
@2386 = ~How can you be so sure?~
@2387 = ~Very well, but even if it is a son, at least he will have a life and an afterlife, unlike me!~
@2388 = ~You. I always think of you. Your life is so fragile... and you want to risk it.~
@2389 = ~For you. For us.~
@2390 = ~But it is your duty to have a heir, isn't it?~
@2391 = ~When I die, there will be nothing left of me, except for a child.~
@2392 = ~Yes, perhaps we are better off as we are. It is too dangerous.~
@2393 = ~Yes... come...~
@2394 = ~Because I love you stronger than you - me.~
@2395 = ~This old superstition?~
@2396 = ~And that is all?~
@2397 = ~You are wrong, Xan. So wrong...~
@2398 = ~Not superstition, no. The truth. We are the People, melamin. We know.~
@2399 = ~It is more than enough. We are the People, melamin. We know.~
@2400 = ~If you think so, do. But you are sadly mistaken, I fear.~
@2401 = ~(sigh) My duty demands it, and now you are asking me the same. But think, what will happen once you hold our son in your arms? You will dissolve into dust; he will suffer my fate. It will only bring more misery.~
@2402 = ~What if, one day, we will be safe? If there is no Bhaal, no Irenicus? What then?~
@2403 = ~No. It will bring us love.~
@2404 = ~Too dangerous, too cruel, too risky... and impossible. But I dream of it, sometimes.~
@2405 = ~Then I will ask you to open your eyes and make certain that you are not dreaming. Stop walking in mirages, <CHARNAME>. To desire something with all your heart does not mean to get it. Be content that we have each other... for now.~
@2406 = ~Let us go, then. And... if you continue hoping against hope...~
@2407 = ~Know that I do, too.~
@2408 = ~For a short moment, yes. Then darkness will come.~
@2409 = ~What for, <CHARNAME>? Why be free at all?~
@2410 = ~You do not ask "why be happy," do you? It is the same with this.~
@2411 = ~What do you mean by "why"? Don't you want to settle down, start a family?~
@2412 = ~Anything is better than wandering the wilderness, isn't it?~
@2413 = ~No, it is not. Happiness is elusive, impossible. Duty is real, and I will not abandon it for a foolish notion of freedom. What will I do, instead?~
@2414 = ~Find some nice girl, marry her, have some small Xans to keep you company in your old age, hmm?~
@2415 = ~Anything! Anything you want: traveling, teaching, reading - anything at all!~
@2416 = ~Oh, you are impossible! So be it. Do pointless errands until you die!~
@2417 = ~Thank you kindly, but your designs matrimonial will have to wait. You do not want a number of brigands to ambush guests at my supposed wedding, do you? Thus, we'll have to deal with them and Irenicus, first.~
@2418 = ~I just can imagine it: "Step aside, Irenicus! You stand in the way of Xan's future happiness!"~
@2419 = ~No, no, no! Irenicus will add spice to your love life, don't you see it?~
@2420 = ~As you would have it. Later, then.~
@2421 = ~Not anything. Whatever I do, loneliness will stay. For now, it is veiled by a false sensation of being needed. If I resign, I will not have even that.~
@2422 = ~Is there nobody in the world who needs you? What of your family, your friends?~
@2423 = ~Poor dear. You are lonely!~
@2424 = ~Why should I care?~
@2425 = ~And I will. But... <CHARNAME>, this fire in your voice...~
@2426 = ~(snort) Indeed. But... <CHARNAME>...~
@2427 = ~(sigh) He has already. But... <CHARNAME>...~
@2428 = ~Yes... later. But... <CHARNAME>...~
@2429 = ~There is no one, yes... no. No, no one, I believe. Why do you ask?~
@2430 = ~Am I? Perhaps... yes. But... <CHARNAME>...~
@2431 = ~You? No, you shouldn't. In fact...~
@2432 = ~Do you care about what happens to me at all? Why would you?~
@2433 = ~I do, because you are my companion and friend. Because I have known you for a long time, and now I see you wasting away!~
@2434 = ~Because no one else does?~
@2435 = ~I do not know, Xan. But I care. Just - care.~
@2436 = ~Me? No, I don't. Why would I?~
@2437 = ~Oh. Thank you, but your concern is unnecessary. We will die very soon, so there's little point in changing the situation anyhow.~
@2438 = ~Is it pity, then? I see. Not a pleasant feeling at all...~
@2439 = ~Indeed. Why would you?~
@2440 = ~Why would I...~
@2441 = ~Should I? You are too dangerous to be trusted, <CHARNAME>.~
@2442 = ~Why is that?~
@2443 = ~Of course, since I am a Child of Bhaal. How could I have forgotten?~
@2444 = ~Try it. You will not be disappointed.~
@2445 = ~You are too different, unpredictable, reckless, beautiful... Oh. I did not say 'beautiful', did I?~
@2446 = ~Regardless, you draw looks - and people. You are too enchanting to be trusted.~
@2447 = ~Enchanting? Then why should I trust you, Enchanter?~
@2448 = ~Was it a compliment?~
@2449 = ~Are you enchanted, then?~
@2450 = ~No, it is not your heritage - not this time, at least.~
@2451 = ~Oh, but I trust you. I am certain that it will not end well, however.~
@2452 = ~Because I do not use any magical or divine means to draw you to myself? (sigh) Perhaps you don't, either, but somehow, I am not so sure.~
@2453 = ~Alas, no. A truth, plain and bitter.~
@2454 = ~Oh, you know what I am going to answer. I am tempted to say 'no': this look of yours with your eyebrows raised is especially enchanting. But I will not, of course.~
@2455 = ~But you are steering this conversation into dangerous territory. Let us finish it - for now, shall we?~
@2456 = ~All this... ah. My journey to Evereska, and then to Amn? No, I did not. It was far too dangerous to have you around.~
@2457 = ~Do you mean that I cannot take care of myself?~
@2458 = ~Very courteous, I see.~
@2459 = ~Why, you could have shielded me with your broad, manly shoulders. Couldn't you?~
@2460 = ~But you missed me, didn't you?~
@2461 = ~Oh, you are adept at what you do. But in your company, I have to do battle, to save innocents, or to pursue some unspeakable evil or another. You are an adventuring type, not a diplomatic one.~
@2462 = ~Why do you continue by my side, then, if it is so dangerous?~
@2463 = ~If force and power can get me what I want, why not?~
@2464 = ~You are mistaken. I am as good at negotiation as you.~
@2465 = ~I have a mission to perform, and so do you. Or are you looking for another motive?~
@2466 = ~Because you are too young and beautiful to be killed by a stray rogue. Or worse. Because I...~
@2467 = ~And still I would hesitate before journeying with you. You are dangerous, <CHARNAME>.~
@2468 = ~What can I say? That I missed you every second of these months? That's what you want to hear, I presume.~
@2469 = ~Never mind what I want to hear! Did you miss me or not?~
@2470 = ~I do not want you to tell me what I want to hear. Just tell me the truth.~
@2471 = ~Hmph. You presume too much. I am not interested in the least.~
@2472 = ~I do not want to hear anything. Just leave me be.~
@2473 = ~That look you are giving me out of the corner of your eye suggests quite the opposite. But I digress.~
@2474 = ~<CHARNAME>, your sense of humor... (sigh) No, I couldn't, and I wouldn't want you to take such risks. Though your company is refreshing, I admit.~
@2475 = ~So, you missed me?~
@2476 = ~Refreshing, and - ?..~
@2477 = ~Not only that. I am also powerful enough to protect you.~
@2478 = ~(sigh) You are intent on getting a straight answer through every possible means, aren't you?~
@2479 = ~And you are intent on not giving it, I see.~
@2480 = ~Yes, I am!~
@2481 = ~Ahhh, never mind. I see that you missed me, and your poor attempts at concealing it are not working for me, not a little bit.~
@2482 = ~Not any longer. You obviously do not care.~
@2483 = ~No, I lost interest. Let us move on.~
@2484 = ~Yes, I missed you, and it will be the doom of me yet!~
@2485 = ~Now, with your permission, I shall leave you be. Why do you always leave me with a dreadful headache?~
@2486 = ~Why ask, then? But I am glad that you deciphered it yourself.~
@2487 = ~I do, <CHARNAME>, it is just...~
@2488 = ~What? Scared to admit it, are you?~
@2489 = ~Just - nothing. Leave me be.~
@2490 = ~As you see fit.~
@2491 = ~Is it another tricky question of yours?~
@2492 = ~No, a perfectly innocent one.~
@2493 = ~Never mind. Just answer me.~
@2494 = ~(sigh) With you, I can never guess... but very well. Yes, I had two dreams, and both were proven futile: planar travel - for its danger, and High Magic - for my fragility. I do not dream or desire now, <CHARNAME>.~
@2495 = ~Not even a little?~
@2496 = ~I do not believe you. Everyone desires something.~
@2497 = ~Well, I do. Will you guess what it is?~
@2498 = ~No. I do not and will not dream again. You dream of beauty, but when you come awake, you only see an orc looming over you with a club. I have had enough of it.~
@2499 = ~What about small desires? Safety, comfort, friends?~
@2500 = ~Oh, but there is an eternal dream. Love.~
@2501 = ~I understand.~
@2502 = ~Illusions all. No, <CHARNAME>, no.~
@2503 = ~An eternal one, yes, and there is a very good reason why it is eternal. It is unreachable.~
@2504 = ~I hoped you would.~
@2505 = ~Something completely inappropriate, I believe. No, I will not guess. You will only ridicule me further if I do.~
@2506 = ~Perhaps. Perhaps not.~
@2507 = ~Is this your opinion of me? Slandering and ridiculing?~
@2508 = ~As you wish. Mind you, I will tell you nothing.~
@2509 = ~Still, my answer is 'no'.~
@2510 = ~No, no... of course not. But since I do not know what to make of your attention, I imagine the worst.~
@2511 = ~Of course, of course. Your way of punishing me, I assume?~
@2512 = ~There is something I do enjoy, however, and you are aware of it. Your presence, and your company. Whether it is truly my heart's desire, I know not, but I do want it to last.~
@2513 = ~But I see I am only digging myself into a deeper hole. Shall we go, before I fall in?~
@2514 = ~Anger is a weapon, and I should know, but it is also more draining than perhaps anything. Why do you ask?~
@2515 = ~Because you are *too* calm. It is unnatural.~
@2516 = ~We witness horrible atrocities each day. They make me mad, and you look as if you don't care!~
@2517 = ~I wish to know you better than I do now.~
@2518 = ~Out of curiosity, I guess.~
@2519 = ~Should I be roaring and fuming, like some berserker? No, thank you. I prefer things as they are.~
@2520 = ~It is impossible to care for everyone. Do you care for every man, woman or child you killed? I think not.~
@2521 = ~But you already do.~
@2522 = ~Ah. Well, then, how can I resist your curiosity?~
@2523 = ~I am prone to blind, white-hot anger sometimes. It does not happen often, and neither is it justified. But once, not long ago, I experienced such fury that I thought I would collapse on the spot. It was terrible... and still is.~
@2524 = ~Why? What caused it?~
@2525 = ~Then you know what it means to be a Child of Bhaal.~
@2526 = ~I see. Well, it is good to know that you are a mere mortal, after all.~
@2527 = ~But you know. You have always known.~
@2528 = ~Not quite. To know it fully, I should have been captured together with you.~
@2529 = ~I am, but you are not - and you have paid for it dearly.~
@2530 = ~Irenicus... I did not know I could hate with such strength. More, it is extremely inconvenient... distracting... pointless. (sigh) I'll have to kill him to get rid of this emotion at last, and since he is extremely powerful, I will be the one to die. A tempting perspective, surely.~
@2531 = ~Can I do anything to shake your unwavering pessimism, I wonder?~
@2532 = ~Forget Irenicus. Let us run away somewhere. Just the two of us.~
@2533 = ~Hey, but you care! What does anything else matter?~
@2534 = ~What for? Life has proven my points time and again.~
@2535 = ~Impossible. He will find, ambush and torture you again, and I shall be able to do nothing, caught by surprise. No, better to face him on our own terms.~
@2536 = ~Is it truly of importance to you? I want to believe it is - as do all men from the beginning of time - but it is highly unlikely. You attract too much attention to notice mine.~
@2537 = ~Ah, but it will be a glorious way to die: killed by an Archmage of some renown, fighting for justice or whatever it is, defending beauty... (sigh) No matter: it is just as pointless.~
@2538 = ~Hmm? Oh, nothing. It is just - ~
@2539 = ~Just what?~
@2540 = ~A dream, including me, a bed of roses, and whipped cream? Or just whips?~
@2541 = ~Hmm, you are not about to blush, are you?~
@2542 = ~Yesterday, by some strange coincidence, I had a dream of you as a child. You had shorter hair, and you were sitting at your room, pouting over some arithmetical exercise.~
@2543 = ~Pouting?!~
@2544 = ~Arithmetic. I HATED it.~
@2545 = ~Yes, I was fond of doing these.~
@2546 = ~(sigh) <CHARNAME>, you and your inflamed imagination...~
@2547 = ~(gulp)~
@2548 = ~No, <CHARNAME>. There is no hope for it whatsoever.~
@2549 = ~Yes. And you are doing it now, as well.~
@2550 = ~Why? The recent days have been far more terrible than chores you had to face back then. But I will continue, if you do not mind.~
@2551 = ~And you were showing your devotion, if I may say so.~
@2552 = ~Then you rose and went to the window, looking out on a green, billowing sea. Your profile was almost black, and so reminiscent of your present self, that I... woke up. (sigh) You are haunting me, <CHARNAME>.~
@2553 = ~Is it a good thing or a bad thing?~
@2554 = ~And you very well know why. Don't you?~
@2555 = ~You know, I had a dream of you as a child, too...~
@2556 = ~For once, I do not want to know.~
@2557 = ~(groan) Please, no! I am well aware of some rather embarrassing moments in my childhood, and it will be just my bad luck that you somehow witnessed these. Let us end this discussion altogether.~
@2558 = ~To pour your soul onto its pages.~
@2559 = ~I have a journal, and while it is more hindrance than help, it is still useful.~
@2560 = ~To write down things, so you wouldn't forget them later.~
@2561 = ~When I was younger, I kept one, but then a certain somebody was impudent enough to read it aloud in front of my young colleagues. It was unpleasant to say the least, so I refrained from such activities from that moment on.~
@2562 = ~Oh. I am so sorry, Xan.~
@2563 = ~What was written there, if I might ask? Was it too intimate?~
@2564 = ~But why? It was an innocent prank, nothing more.~
@2565 = ~Not to mention that you have this adorable look when you bend over its pages... but my mind wanders.~
@2566 = ~I have an excellent memory. No, if I ever needed a journal, it was not for that purpose.~
@2567 = ~It happened a year after my father died, and my grief was seeking a release. It sounds pretentious, I know, but I simply could not speak about it... and I could not keep it inside. I could not... oh, but forget this. I do not wish to earn your scorn, as well.~
@2568 = ~It is all right. I will not laugh. Tell me.~
@2569 = ~Very well.~
@2570 = ~Then you are weak, and you were weak before, as well.~
@2571 = ~No, it was not the account of my victories - or, rather, defeats - on the fields of love, in case you are wondering.~
@2572 = ~Oh, you would say so, would you?~
@2573 = ~No... no. I know that you lost Gorion, and I am aware of how hard it must have been, but I do not want to drown in misery again, and neither do I wish to drag you with me. Let us go.~
@2574 = ~Yes... let us go.~
@2575 = ~I prefer this weakness to your brutality, then. Excuse me.~
@2576 = ~Others? Do you imply loving Irenicus, who crippled your spirit? Or not despising the creatures of slime? Or, perhaps, bearing friendly feelings towards every orc and goblin who tried to crush your skull?~
@2577 = ~Stop twisting my words! I meant those closest to you.~
@2578 = ~Ummm... no?~
@2579 = ~Yes. Even them. Every creature of this world.~
@2580 = ~Do be so kind to point those out, first. I doubt that you will be able to. I have nothing and no one to love, <CHARNAME>. Only memories.~
@2581 = ~Nothing? What about...~
@2582 = ~I am sorry for you, then.~
@2583 = ~It is a large world we live in. Find someone, why don't you?~
@2584 = ~Exactly. There is no point in love, or indeed anything, in this life. None.~
@2585 = ~But what about family, friends, children? You love them, I assume?~
@2586 = ~What about loving the world? Making it a better place?~
@2587 = ~No, there is one. Living.~
@2588 = ~It is so sad...~
@2589 = ~The world is doomed. Trying to change it is as futile as to fight nothingness. But I am spouting platitudes again, am I not? It is a pointless discussion, <CHARNAME>.~
@2590 = ~I do not think so. You need to find a goal in this life, and I want to help you.~
@2591 = ~Everything is pointless for you! Why do I even bother?~
@2592 = ~Very well. I'll leave you alone, then.~
@2593 = ~Living... Do you live? You exist, and fear your death every minute. It is hollow, and pointless. Let us go.~
@2594 = ~Your death is certain, and you are sorry for me? (sigh) Madness...~
@2595 = ~Thank you, but it is, as I said, pointless.~
@2596 = ~I would like to know this, as well.~
@2597 = ~Yes, if you please.~
@2598 = ~No. And "no" again. Excuse me.~
@2599 = ~"Finding" someone, in case you did not know, requires mutual feelings. Stop irritating me, <CHARNAME>. Or are you simply blind? I wonder sometimes...~
@2600 = ~What? Protect you? From Irenicus, from... everything? How can I?~
@2601 = ~I thought you couldn't. Coward.~
@2602 = ~Won't you even try?~
@2603 = ~Do not, then.~
@2604 = ~No, you misunderstand me. I will try and die and - whatever you wish, I will do. But my promises are worthless. I gave them before, and then... then there was not even a grave.~
@2605 = ~I see. Well, if you try, it is enough for me.~
@2606 = ~It was useless to ask you, then.~
@2607 = ~You promised to protect someone before, and failed?~
@2608 = ~Thank you. If you trust me with your life, then I am honored. Very.~
@2609 = ~It is not a romantic story, so you may stop looking so interested. It was a regular mission, and I survived by pure luck. It was pure irony, since my companions were renown for their good fortune, and I for my doomsaying. Nevertheless, they are dead, and I stand before you.~
@2610 = ~Still, you are doomed. Soon, I will be standing at your grave - if there is a grave.~
@2611 = ~There is no need for this hopeful tone, you know.~
@2612 = ~No, no and no! By now, you should know that I AM INVINCIBLE!~
@2613 = ~So true... and so hopeless.~
@2614 = ~You may gather some dust from my remains and keep it close to your heart. Very romantic.~
@2615 = ~But you laugh in difficult times, <CHARNAME>. I admire that.~
@2616 = ~Indeed. I will try to protect you, but... (sigh) Let us just go.~
@2617 = ~No, <CHARNAME>. Unlike dust, memory is evergreen.~
@2618 = ~(sigh) Perfect. Just perfect. What do you expect me to say? Or should I wait for your triumphant laughter? Play your pranks on someone else, if you will.~
@2619 = ~Hmph. You are no fun at all.~
@2620 = ~All right! Anomen? Anooomen! I have something to tell youuuuu!~
@2621 = ~All right! Cernd? Hey, Cernd! I have something to tell youuuuu!~
@2622 = ~All right! Edwin? Edwiiin! I have something to tell youuuuu!~
@2623 = ~All right! Haer'Dalis? Haer'Daliiis! I have something to tell youuuuu!~
@2624 = ~All right! Keldorn? Keeeldorn! I have something to tell youuuuu!~
@2625 = ~All right! Minsc? Miiinsc! I have something to tell youuuuu!~
@2626 = ~All right! Valygar? Valygaaar! I have something to tell youuuuu!~
@2627 = ~All right! Yoshimo? Yoshiiimo! I have something to tell youuuuu!~
@2628 = ~But... I was not joking...~
@2629 = ~Fine! You will not hear from me again - ever!~
@2630 = ~And this is exactly the way I prefer it to be.~
@2631 = ~There is less pain this way, too.~
@2632 = ~(sigh) Seldarine, you are insufferable...~
@2633 = ~N-no? <CHARNAME>...~
@2634 = ~Wait. I do not want to advance our relationship. Let the things stay as they are, for now.~
@2635 = ~No. Would I lie to you?~
@2636 = ~What? You do not love me?~
@2637 = ~Hahaha! Ooooh, just look at you!~
@2638 = ~Untrue. You will speak to me in a few moments, issuing another order. I will hear your voice again... and it all will begin anew. (sigh) An inescapable tide.~
@2639 = ~It is so unexpected... so impossible...~
@2640 = ~But come. We have much to discuss... and to reach Imoen and Irenicus, as well, do we not?~
@2641 = ~Shhh... I do.~
@2642 = ~Just leave me be.~
@2643 = ~<CHARNAME>... thank you. But we were apart for a year, and barely met again. Give it time... please. Give it time.~
@2644 = ~You are wiser than me; I always said so. Very well.~
@2645 = ~(choke) <CHARNAME>, are you always this forward, or is this day a special one?~
@2646 = ~Hmm... both, and neither.~
@2647 = ~Forward? Only with you.~
@2648 = ~But if it softens your heart and heals mine, will you not let me try?~
@2649 = ~I wasn't serious, silly! Though the idea has merit...~
@2650 = ~It probably does not matter, since my answer will be the same.~
@2651 = ~You are flattering me again, I see... but I can give you only one answer.~
@2652 = ~No. Your taint hangs over my shoulder like a sword ready to fall, and it will fall, if we take this step. If - or when - I know that you are safe, then... then... Stop looking at me so! My heart is not made of stone, and you know it all too well!~
@2653 = ~Yes, I do! We know each other, trust each other - what is left to prove?~
@2654 = ~Why, Xan, are you expecting me to go on a murderous rampage in the heat of passion?~
@2655 = ~Certainly, dear. When I am free of my taint, do let me know. I wouldn't want to miss it.~
@2656 = ~I am forsaken. Cast away! Misunderstood, chagrined and wronged! Begone from my sight!~
@2657 = ~(sigh) I keep hoping, somehow.~
@2658 = ~I do not suppose it is a good time to tell you how beautiful you are when you are mad, is it?~
@2659 = ~No! Leave me be!~
@2660 = ~Hm? Did you just say 'beautiful'?~
@2661 = ~Why, you are not bad looking, either.~
@2662 = ~No. In fact, it is a good time to end this altogether.~
@2663 = ~You were the one to start this conversation. But as you wish.~
@2664 = ~I did.~
@2665 = ~Why, thank you, I suppose.~
@2666 = ~Now, before I forget myself entirely... shall we go?~
@2667 = ~I see. It shall be as you say, of course.~
@2668 = ~I never doubted you. But everything has its time and place, melamin, and this is my last word on the matter.~
@2669 = ~Pfft!~
@2670 = ~

Very well, I shall cease .... for the time being.~
@2671 = ~Remember these words, Xan of Evereska, for you will surely regret them.~
@2672 = ~Love is out of the question, I see. But what about a drink?~
@2673 = ~(sigh) I will, I doubt it not.~
@2674 = ~I have suspicions about your sudden indifference, to be honest. But as you wish...~
@2675 = ~(You pour Elverquist into two glasses.)~
@2676 = ~(Xan's glass contains very strong ale.)~
@2677 = ~Delicious. Now, shall we go?~
@2678 = ~What is this? The smell of the thing! (cough) No, thank you. Another time - and I hope it was not another prank of yours. We'd better go.~
@2679 = ~(cough) <CHARNAME>! What in the name of Corellon is this?~
@2680 = ~Oh, I am so sorry! I accidentally poured you the wrong drink. Um, can you walk at all?~
@2681 = ~A badly disguised attempt at seduction. What else did you expect?~
@2682 = ~Well, I have never seen you actually drunk, and now I got my wish!~
@2683 = ~I do not... think so. Oooh, my head spins worse than... I am surely going to fall.~
@2684 = ~Poor Xan... but it will pass very soon, trust me.~
@2685 = ~Never mind. Let us go.~
@2686 = ~Now, what about a night of love you so incautiously promised?~
@2687 = ~You are totally drunk. Good. Now... love me like there's no tomorrow.~
@2688 = ~You got... what you wanted... I presume. Oooh, my head worse than... I am surely going to fall.~
@2689 = ~(groan) It was cruel of you, <CHARNAME>. But since you are the leader, lead. I will try my best not to die.~
@2690 = ~But there is no tomorrow, <CHARNAME>.~
@2691 = ~It is hopeless. The legends of half-gods and mortals coming together in love are little more than drunken tales. But since... since it *is* a drunken tale, I suppose that everything is possible, even this.~
@2692 = ~Not that I ever expected any gratitude, but I hoped you would notice that I am still here, and risking my life for you, at that. Or does it mean nothing to you?~
@2693 = ~It doesn't. But I hoped you would stay with me as a lover and a friend, not a silent shadow.~
@2694 = ~Nothing! Nothing at all! I do not need your pathetic skills! I need you!~
@2695 = ~It means a lot, despite everything. Thank you... I suppose.~
@2696 = ~Oh, forget this. Just... just leave me be!~
@2697 = ~<CHARNAME>, you will have anyone you want. You need not die cold and alone, comforted only by the knowledge that nobody loves you. You do not need me, and more so because I am afraid to be with you.~
@2698 = ~You are afraid because of a single incident. If you try to forget it, we may yet be together.~
@2699 = ~How can you be afraid of me? I don't understand.~
@2700 = ~Never mind. Go back to ignoring me, then.~
@2701 = ~Oh, but you are always welcome, and you know this. Hating me, however, will not help.~
@2702 = ~I do not hate you, but I am mad at you - and will be, for a long time.~
@2703 = ~What do you propose? Thanking you, perhaps?~
@2704 = ~I am sorry, Xan. Please, ignore my words.~
@2705 = ~Not surprisingly, it was exactly what I was doing. Excuse me...~
@2706 = ~You are asking me to forget the impossible. You want me to forget how the hands I kissed were clawing out my eyes.~
@2707 = ~Ah, of course. How can such a tiny matter as the warm embrace of the Slayer influence my view of you?~
@2708 = ~I understand, <CHARNAME>. I am not the happiest of men, myself - though, unlike you, I do not have the luxury of shouting it out on every corner. But you will come to terms with my decision... eventually. Let us continue, for now.~
@2709 = ~We've been together for too short a time. Had we years, things might have been different. But as it is, what we had died before it was even born, and I do not even have the name for this feeling. Let us continue.~
@2710 = ~I do not know, <CHARNAME>. I do not know...~
@2711 = ~Do not know - or do not want to tell?~
@2712 = ~You never loved me, did you?~
@2713 = ~You still love me, don't you?~
@2714 = ~Oh, never mind.~
@2715 = ~(sigh) You are such a child, <CHARNAME>. Love is not born in a moment, to exist forever. It grows, withers and dies, as we are meant to do.~
@2716 = ~I... am fond of you. Every day, I come awake with this thought, but then your Slayer form emerges before my eyes, and I have to live with both of these memories. It is hard. Very.~
@2717 = ~But if I am your hope, won't you put your trust in me, and stop treating me as murder incarnate?~
@2718 = ~It will be over soon. I shall become whole again, and the Slayer's shadow will depart. Trust me.~
@2719 = ~You have to put up with mere memories, and I have to live without my spirit, and in constant fear, too! Now, which of us gets a better deal?~
@2720 = ~It is a sad life that we both lead.~
@2721 = ~I trust you. I never stopped trusting you, even if I implied otherwise. But I do not believe it can end well.~
@2722 = ~We are both doomed. Your doom seems more certain, but in truth, our chances to die together increase every hour.~
@2723 = ~It will be over soon, anyway. I almost feel it coming to an end. Had we chosen to confront Irenicus straight away, without the inmates' help, both of us would be now lying in some abandoned crypt.~
@2724 = ~Oh, but of course. I knew I was doomed from the start.~
@2725 = ~You are a destructive entity. Wherever you go, whatever you do, chaos erupts. Since you do not do it consciously, you cannot control it. Should you unleash the Slayer, you will doom us all. Should you restrain yourself, you will delay the disaster, but it will come, regardless.~
@2726 = ~Well, excuse me for tainting your precious company with my wicked presence! Shall I depart now?~
@2727 = ~Good! Now I see that I, the Child of Bhaal, am worthy of my destiny!~
@2728 = ~You are judging me too harshly. I am no saint, but no demon, either.~
@2729 = ~Another monologue about my disastrous nature, I see. How tired I am of those...~
@2730 = ~I did not judge you; Alaundo's words did. I merely recited them. Your fate may not be to your liking: neither is it to mine. But as every powerful being born at the exodus of an era, you are a victim of circumstances, and will never be able to have a say in your destiny.~
@2731 = ~As soon as Irenicus dies, I shall.~
@2732 = ~We'll see about that, shall we?~
@2733 = ~Why are you telling me this?~
@2734 = ~Yes, the word "child" narrates your behavior adequately. (sigh) You are playing with forces which devour the likes of you within moments, and without thinking. When you come to realize it, it will be too late.~
@2735 = ~You were the one who started this discussion. As for your question - I will stand by you against Irenicus until the end. My own end, I do not doubt...~
@2736 = ~I doubt it.~
@2737 = ~It will not be over with Irenicus' death. Your other siblings will rise, as Alaundo has prophesied, and what will you do? No, do not answer: I am certain I would not like to hear another passionate speech about destroying evil, or, worse, taking your sire's place. Your intent does not matter: your place in the prophecy is already defined.~
@2738 = ~You are wrong, Xan. I will forge my destiny myself.~
@2739 = ~I do not think so. The prophecy is not centered on me, so the possibilities are endless.~
@2740 = ~Defined? What do you mean?~
@2741 = ~I am telling you this so you will understand: there is no place for me by your side. I will leave you, <CHARNAME>. I will have to.~
@2742 = ~So has your sire thought when he wrought misery and despair on Faerun, but where is he now? He fell prey to the Time of Troubles, and his knowledge did not aid him. Your chances to perish are even higher, for you are stumbling around blindly.~
@2743 = ~But each of them ends with the same result. Do I need to tell you what it is?~
@2744 = ~Bhaal planned his own resurrection. However powerful you might be, you will submit to his plans in the end. At best, you will live another year or two. At worst, you will die tomorrow.~
@2745 = ~Yes, yes, I respect your vigilance. Now, if you will excuse me, I have to sort my spell components...~
@2746 = ~Oh? I thought you'd pay more attention to my words.~
@2747 = ~Xan, are you all right? You sound so... indifferent.~
@2748 = ~Of course, of course. Take your time.~
@2749 = ~Hmm? Oh, I should care, I know. I do not, though.~
@2750 = ~I... I said this aloud, did I not? You are without a soul, and I have said this aloud... Forgive me. Let us move on, as we should.~
@2751 = ~No, no. Could you please repeat what you have just said?~
@2752 = ~You do not care about me any longer, do you?~
@2753 = ~Yes, let us do so. Thank you for making yourself clear.~
@2754 = ~I certainly shall.~
@2755 = ~Do you truly wish to hear this again?~
@2756 = ~I suppose not.~
@2757 = ~No, I think that I understood your meaning well enough.~
@2758 = ~Your face no longer cleaves my heart in two. Time... pain... the Underdark... the Slayer... Those were too strong. It was an infatuation, as I told you before, and it has passed.~
@2759 = ~Oh. Well. I see.~
@2760 = ~A rather unusual confession, I must say.~
@2761 = ~Refreshing. Men told me they loved me, but not the other way around.~
@2762 = ~I hoped we could be together, one day...~
@2763 = ~How dare you!~
@2764 = ~I am sorry.~
@2765 = ~And you will be right. I am sorry, <CHARNAME>.~
@2766 = ~Yes. All I have now is ashes, revenge and duty. Perhaps duty will spur me onwards, if love cannot.~
@2767 = ~Unusual? Refreshing? It is better than if you have found it cruel and cold... but I hurt you, I know. Forgive me, if you can.~
@2768 = ~Hopeless. It is the damned whom you love, and by love you are damned. No, <CHARNAME>, no.~
@2769 = ~I would be seriously alarmed if you did not. The Shadow Thieves are not to be trifled with.~
@2770 = ~I am no stranger to unsavory tasks, don't you worry.~
@2771 = ~Shame. I have just been planning to betray them...~
@2772 = ~Excuse me? What do you have against thieves?~
@2773 = ~Stop spouting platitudes! Do you have anything useful to say or not?~
@2774 = ~Oh, but it's not just that.~
@2775 = ~Don't you even dream of it! No divine powers will save you from a knife in your throat.~
@2776 = ~<CHARNAME>, much as I respect your... abilities, a thief is not a generally nice person, who just *happens* to know how to disarm traps in dark dungeons. Your brethren are not to be trusted.~
@2777 = ~Useful? What is "useful" in your meaning? A location of the treasure hoard? A legend about some ancient evil? A rumor about another unfortunate soul, willing to join our doomed party? In this case - no. I simply want to warn you.~
@2778 = ~They will watch your every step, look into your plate and into your bed, make you perform their dirty work - and dismiss you in the end. Be wary.~
@2779 = ~Of course, I paid them fifteen thousand gold only to be privileged to do their dirty work! How very insightful of you!~
@2780 = ~Contrary to what you think, there is honor among thieves.~
@2781 = ~Well, thank you for the warning.~
@2782 = ~I will watch out, but what can I do? They are too powerful!~
@2783 = ~I pray it will never turn out that it has been indeed insightful of me. But enough of this.~
@2784 = ~There might be, but you are an outsider, so you will be killed together with the rest. Do not trust them.~
@2785 = ~You are welcome. Though it is indeed pointless.~
@2786 = ~What will you do? Oh, but I know it very well. You will slowly and carefully retreat, leaving a certain someone to distract your enemies. Me. (sigh) Let us hope that it will not come to this.~
@2787 = ~I did warn you not to listen to her. Do you think that words can change anything now? We should obey if we are to stay alive.~
@2788 = ~All right, I made a mistake! Satisfied now?~
@2789 = ~I know, but it is still... creepy.~
@2790 = ~And we shall. Follow me!~
@2791 = ~<CHARNAME>, I was not trying to force a confession out of you. You are young; it is natural that you have made a mistake.~
@2792 = ~Yes.~
@2793 = ~(sigh) It shall be as you say.~
@2794 = ~Our position is not fatal, yet. Bodhi needs you for some reason, and it makes you valuable. Not me, certainly. (sigh) I have always been expendable, and it has not changed.~
@2795 = ~Stop talking rubbish! Do I look as if I was going to feed you to these monsters?~
@2796 = ~We'll get through. I know we will.~
@2797 = ~Well, if *you* see hope, than we have it, I am sure.~
@2798 = ~Giving you to Bodhi? What a splendid idea!~
@2799 = ~Who knows, <CHARNAME>? You may add another folly to the rest. You signed a pact with her... you may do anything.~
@2800 = ~I doubt it. It's not that you want to die, you just do not seem to want to do anything else.~
@2801 = ~Hope? Hope for the allies of a powerful vampire? We are beyond hope, beneath contempt, wretched and bereft of any virtue. No, <CHARNAME>. We are doomed.~
@2802 = ~(shudder)~
@2803 = ~We are doomed, as I told you. Though... do you think we have a chance?~
@2804 = ~What, do you want words of comfort and consolation?~
@2805 = ~Maybe. I do not care, to tell you the truth.~
@2806 = ~Well, we are alive and powerful, aren't we?~
@2807 = ~A chance? Here? Of course not!~
@2808 = ~Everybody needs these at times, don't they? But I would much rather see the light of day again.~
@2809 = ~Tough luck, then. We are doomed.~
@2810 = ~You will. We are strong; we can make it.~
@2811 = ~What is the point?~
@2812 = ~What? You do not care? Ah... your soul is gone, and your emotions are fading. But surely, you still want to live?~
@2813 = ~I do, but it seems I will not be given a chance to do so.~
@2814 = ~I don't know. I know we're powerful enough to make it, though.~
@2815 = ~No. I've no desire to go on.~
@2816 = ~We are, but we were very much alive and powerful when Irenicus captured you, too, and look what had happened! No, <CHARNAME>. We must try hard if we want to get out of here.~
@2817 = ~That is what I think. I do not want us to perish here, however.~
@2818 = ~You have nothing to lose; you are empty. But I would still like to get us out, and I need you for this. Without your leadership, we will become some shark's dinner even today.~
@2819 = ~I will keep trying alongside of you, but... (sigh)~
@2820 = ~...we are doomed.~
@2821 = ~...but since I do not have a soul, you suspect I will only hinder you.~
@2822 = ~...but?~
@2823 = ~I did not say that!~
@2824 = ~...but I indeed think so. (sigh) <CHARNAME>, I am not going to berate you, or worse, abandon you. But your emptiness scares me. Please, do hold on, while you may. Your old self is gone, but even its shattered remains are better than what lies beneath.~
@2825 = ~...but your emptiness scares me. Please, do hold on, while you may. Your old self is gone, but even its shattered remains are better than what lies beneath.~
@2826 = ~No. Not like us. I would never... you would never...~
@2827 = ~Though you would, wouldn't you? You would take someone's spirit, if it helped you survive. You are no less dangerous than Irenicus is.~
@2828 = ~First you are afraid of me, then you call me a destructive entity, and now I am worse than Irenicus. Very nice. Should I expect you attacking me next?~
@2829 = ~Me? I am a living image of death and danger! I make alliances with drow, shatter human and elven cities alike, and steal souls daily! Oh, wait. It was Irenicus. A tiny mistake.~
@2830 = ~It is difficult to believe that mere days ago you would defend me against anyone who would repeat this.~
@2831 = ~Yes, and you traveled with me, despite this. You wouldn't have blinked if I destroyed Athkatla. You only fear damage to your precious self.~
@2832 = ~You are becoming similar to Irenicus, slowly, but inevitably. I no longer feel you as I do Elhan or my other elven brethren: you are fading.~
@2833 = ~I am almost loath to ask, but do you remember anything at all? Compassion, care, love?~
@2834 = ~Of course. It's been mere days since Irenicus stripped me of my spirit.~
@2835 = ~I have not changed, Xan. I remember everything.~
@2836 = ~It is dull and empty... I do not think there is any point in remembering any more.~
@2837 = ~Why do you ask? You do not care, do you?~
@2838 = ~Things change, don't they?~
@2839 = ~Yes, I was out of my mind. I forgot about your heritage, my duty - everything. I was pathetic, but it will not happen again.~
@2840 = ~You remember, but you are changing. What will happen next, I wonder?~
@2841 = ~This is not good at all. What will happen next, I wonder?~
@2842 = ~I would not want you to wither and die like Irenicus was going to. But if I see that you are becoming like him, as ruthless and uncaring about life and the living, I will...~
@2843 = ~(sigh) No, I will do nothing. A fool I am, but I cannot raise a blade against you, and I never will. Let us go.~
@2844 = ~Indeed we are - if we survive Irenicus, that is. I hope that my company did not prove too tiring.~
@2845 = ~No, it was fine. Actually, I'll miss you.~
@2846 = ~You were useful enough, I suppose.~
@2847 = ~Your company? You tired me to death!~
@2848 = ~I thought it was you who grew weary of my company.~
@2849 = ~Yes, I was of some use, I imagine.~
@2850 = ~No. You were a friend.~
@2851 = ~You were of very much use.~
@2852 = ~Yes, and now what will I do without a wizard in my party?!~
@2853 = ~I expected as much. Well, you will not be sorry to see me go, then.~
@2854 = ~Actually... Xan, I will.~
@2855 = ~No, I won't. Let someone else endure your whining.~
@2856 = ~I will be a party member short! What do you expect me to do?~
@2857 = ~Good riddance to bad rubbish.~
@2858 = ~You know it was different. No, I will remember your company with fondness, despite everything. Not for long, though: with death and danger circling Evereska, I will probably perish within a year from now. I will miss you.~
@2859 = ~I do not believe you. You do not care.~
@2860 = ~Well, I will not! Not after what you have done!~
@2861 = ~Perhaps we shall meet again some day?~
@2862 = ~I will miss you, too.~
@2863 = ~Why, thank you for your kind words... if you are serious, that is. Shall we bid each other a clumsy farewell and continue? I cannot stop while Irenicus continues and threatens us all.~
@2864 = ~Yes, let us continue.~
@2865 = ~Of course. I am glad that we said our goodbyes.~
@2866 = ~I have this nagging feeling that I have forgotten to ask you something...~
@2867 = ~You will find someone else, I presume. But it is pointless to continue this discussion. Yes, I will go, and yes, you will jovially kick me farewell - and no, it will not happen, since Irenicus' magic will tear me to bits and pieces. Let us go.~
@2868 = ~I expected this. Well, you will not have to endure me for long.~
@2869 = ~But I care... for your well-being, if not for your heart. As for what I have done - I will be punished for this. Hanali is merciless... I know I will. Come. We have talked enough.~
@2870 = ~What for? It is over. I wish you well, but I do not want to experience all this pain again - and worse pain, when you abandon me to death, godhood or another. Come. We have talked enough.~
@2871 = ~I... <CHARNAME>...~
@2872 = ~Seldarine, I thought I have forgotten, but now it returns, and stronger - ~
@2873 = ~No. We shall defeat Irenicus or die. In the former case, I will never see you again, as I should. Let us go.~
@2874 = ~Try to guide us alive through this, will you?~
@2875 = ~So am I. Try to guide us alive through this, will you?~
@2876 = ~It is probably unimportant - or, if it is, you will only remember it when I am dead and gone. Such is the irony of our lives. (sigh) Shall we go?~
@2877 = ~Seldarine... I have... I have never seen anything as... majestic.~ [O#XAN218]
@2878 = ~Majestic? I thought you'd say 'terrifying' or the like.~
@2879 = ~It is inspiring, I agree.~
@2880 = ~Hmmm... it would make a good stronghold of sorts.~
@2881 = ~It is a human construction, not elven, but I see its beauty regardless. A perfect shelter, an impenetrable stronghold, an ideal... prison.~
@2882 = ~A shelter? Would *you* want to live here?~
@2883 = ~A stronghold? Why, I like the idea.~
@2884 = ~A prison? I wonder, who is contained within?~
@2885 = ~Yes, the place draws the eye, I suppose.~
@2886 = ~In times of danger... why not? A threat approaches, <CHARNAME>. A major threat, compared to which, this 'Imprisoned One' is but a trio of stray gibberlings. This threat is you - you and your siblings, who are prophesied to tear this world apart.~
@2887 = ~But it is irrelevant now. It will come; let us speak no more of it. As for the Imprisoned One...~
@2888 = ~You will see a hole in the gutter and claim it your own. What will you do with your multiple possessions?~
@2889 = ~Oh, but never mind: I definitely do not want to know.~
@2890 = ~One they call the Imprisoned One. I know nothing more of the creature, however.~
@2891 = ~Do you intend to proceed? A foolish question, of course: you do. But... is there a slimmest chance that I will make you change your mind and return to the less dangerous tasks?~
@2892 = ~I am sorry, Xan, but - no.~
@2893 = ~Are you joking? Of course not!~
@2894 = ~What would you call less dangerous? Hunting kobolds? Or helping Amnish farmers with their harvest? I need strength to fight Irenicus, and I will have it!~
@2895 = ~I just might, actually...~
@2896 = ~Why, yes. Persuade me.~
@2897 = ~As I thought.~
@2898 = ~No, <CHARNAME>. I never joke about saving our lives. You, on the other hand, are doing everything to make our lives a joke.~
@2899 = ~You - will - have - it. (sigh) I see.~
@2900 = ~I've nothing to add, it seems.~
@2901 = ~Think of leaving, then, before it is too late. You will be able to return here later, I am sure. As for now... let us depart. Please.~
@2902 = ~(sigh) When you adopt such a tone, I very well see there is no point.~
@2903 = ~If you don't want me because of what I am, I'll embrace it. I'll become more terrible than you could ever imagine. Everyone will suffer.~
@2904 = ~Really? Why, I am impressed.~
@2905 = ~And I should stay and help you in this transformation, I imagine?~
@2906 = ~Oh, no. You have helped enough. You are here to witness it.~
@2907 = ~But it is your duty to stop me. Isn't it?~
@2908 = ~Don't you want to stop me?~
@2909 = ~Yes... it was stupid of me. But what can I do to make you stay?~
@2910 = ~I won't. If you are going to become the horror you are talking about, you'll dispose of me first.~
@2911 = ~My duty... It is a fickle word, <CHARNAME>. One might say that my duty is to stay clear of you and the terror you are going to unleash. One might also say that my duty is to report to Evereska and to continue with my tasks.~
@2912 = ~No, <CHARNAME>. I am powerless. If I could, though... why would I? It is your decision alone.~
@2913 = ~Do you want to?~
@2914 = ~I am not keen on upholding balance. It is as empty as Good or Evil. I try to do what is right, but I end up doing what I must. And I must go.~
@2915 = ~But what if you return, and find out you have made the wrong choice?~
@2916 = ~You have a choice. You may return to Evereska - and know that somewhere, thousands are suffering because of you.~
@2917 = ~Think of your moonblade, Xan. What does it advise you?~
@2918 = ~Don't you see that I will break down and become a monster, once you leave? Help me, Xan.~
@2919 = ~Go, then. If you must, when you must... I have nothing else to say.~
@2920 = ~I do not know. I will think on it, that much I can promise.~
@2921 = ~Nothing else.~
@2922 = ~It does not advise. It...~
@2923 = ~This... this was cruel. What am I to say?~
@2924 = ~And you would be right.~
@2925 = ~Ah, it is you again. I'll be happy to offer you a room, but you'd best keep yourself as low profile as possible. I don't want any trouble, here.~
@2926 = ~Don't you remember anything, Xan? Anything?~
@2927 = ~I am sorry, <CHARNAME>, but I do not understand what you are talking about. Or... or I indeed do not remember.~
@2928 = ~I know, Aerie. I feel the same. But hang on for a little while, will you? It won't be long.~
@2929 = ~I... I am scared of what <CHARNAME> might do. Do you think that <PRO_HESHE> will kill him?~
@2930 = ~I don't know. But it will be over soon. One way or another... and someone will assuredly be dead by the end of the day. Come, or we'll lag behind the others.~
@2931 = ~This 'halfling friend' is <CHARNAME>'s former acquaintance, and his life is in peril. Do you expect <CHARNAME> to leave him to his fate? If so, do not be surprised if the same happens to you... some day.~
@2932 = ~How dare you compare me to this base thief!~
@2933 = ~You started it.~
@2934 = ~And I shall finish it. Enough is enough.~
@2935 = ~Are you sure that you will manage alone? It is not a safe journey, doubly so with a child on your hands.~
@2936 = ~I will manage, my friend. Thank you for asking, but now I must go.~
@2937 = ~Safe travels to you, then. (sigh) I just hope your son will be safe in the Grove.~
@2938 = ~Now that Faldorn is dead, he has nothing to fear. I will see to his safety and needs.~
@2939 = ~Edwin... are you sure this is safe?~
@2940 = ~Sure? Ignorant lout, you are talking to the Red Wizard of Thay! Of course I am sure! (Bah, these peasants...)~
@2941 = ~Are you surprised? I expected nothing less.~
@2942 = ~And you are right, since *you* deserve it, while *I* do not. <CHARNAME>, I suggest he takes the first blow, since his life is the least valuable one here.~
@2943 = ~Why, thank you very much, Edwin. But now, perhaps, we shall listen to their plan?~
@2944 = ~Not to mention how utterly base this is.~
@2945 = ~Oh, but our impressive hostess will claim her own, one way or the other. Such is the way of every grand tale.~
@2946 = ~With the smallest exception: normally, it is heroes who risk their neck. In this case, it will be *us*.~
@2947 = ~See, bard? I told you it would come to that!~
@2948 = ~The way of the entropy, my dear petrel, the way of the entropy...~
@2949 = ~Such bloodlust, Imoen. You are truly a Child of Bhaal.~
@2950 = ~What do you want me to do? Cry? She nearly killed us!~
@2951 = ~Not to be so happy about it? Ah, but it is hopeless.~
@2952 = ~Glad you think so. Sheesh. Some people...~
@2953 = ~Yes, but whose life do you value more? His or yours?~
@2954 = ~We may be able to save both. There is no need to rush headfirst into battle, this is all I am saying.~
@2955 = ~But if we display mercy, we will be discovered - and killed. Slowly. Are you willing to take this risk for Solaufein?~
@2956 = ~There will be no risk involved, if he is willing to cooperate. If he is not... we shall see. Come, enough dallying here. Phaere might get suspicious.~
@2957 = ~Oh, but of course. At your command, powerful female.~
@2958 = ~(snort)~
@2959 = ~A catapult. Why, yes, we are in luck indeed. <CHARNAME>, why don't you boot him from the party? Your life expectancy will increase for several hours at the very least.~
@2960 = ~There, there, no need to panic! With me, you are safer than with anyone else! Trust me.~
@2961 = ~Do you consider killing your former comrades, then?~
@2962 = ~I pray it will not come to this. But if they do not listen to reason, I shall do what I must.~
@2963 = ~I suppose. I would... hesitate in your place, however.~
@2964 = ~The church is a harsh mistress, my friend. It is a sad task, but I shall do my utmost.~
@2965 = ~Why? Did you spend your childhood on the streets, too?~
@2966 = ~No, I was fortunate. I have seen many who were not, however. You would do well to treat them with less harshness, <CHARNAME>.~
@2967 = ~For once, I agree completely.~
@2968 = ~Then what are ye all bloody waiting for? Onwards!~
@2969 = ~But what if he is innocent, Korgan? What then?~
@2970 = ~Bah! Guilty, innocent, damned if I care! Kill him and be done, if he offers no profit!~
@2971 = ~(hiss) Mazzy! Enough of this!~
@2972 = ~What? I must step in! Surely you are fuming at this injustice, too!~
@2973 = ~But you tried, and almost succeeded. Reckless, true... but admirable. Admirable that you still have your head attached, that is.~
@2974 = ~It is important that I have challenged him, though. One day, these prejudices will cease. I swear it.~
@2975 = ~Perhaps, while you are at it, you will also swear not to pick fights with opponents twice your size?~
@2976 = ~Oh, just leave me alone!~
@2977 = ~Minsc, I do not think it is wise - ~
@2978 = ~It is a stinking, cowardly thing to do, to attack helpless animals! I shall not allow it!~
@2979 = ~Of course, of course. It will be all right, all right... all right...~
@2980 = ~Zzzz...~
@2981 = ~Oh. Perhaps I *have* overdone it a little...~
@2982 = ~Pretty words, from a thief. What did you expect from your profession, if I may ask?~
@2983 = ~I never thought it would come to this! This - this is blasphemy! Don't you have any respect?~
@2984 = ~I fear the gods' ire. But if you seriously expect that nothing we do angers them, best think again. <CHARNAME>'s very existence is a sacrilege.~
@2985 = ~We... we are to enter this thing in a moment, are we?~
@2986 = ~Yes. Is something the matter?~
@2987 = ~No, nothing. I am simply saying my farewells to the sky.~
@2988 = ~Perhaps I should do the same.~
@2989 = ~(sigh) Perhaps.~
@2990 = ~Now... shall we?~
@2991 = ~Yes. Yes, of course. Seldarine, my legs are leaden...~
@2992 = ~Xan, do not tell <CHARNAME>... but mine are, too.~
@2993 = ~Oh. Why, I feel much better now.~
@2994 = ~I thought you would. Come, let's go.~
@2995 = ~Can you... see them?~
@2996 = ~Hmm? Ah, so the darthiir asks for help. Perhaps you need me in the party, after all?~
@2997 = ~I never doubted your skills. In fact, I trust in *all* your skills, and this is exactly why I want you to leave. A highly competent drow priestess, adept at poisoning and stabbing in the back, is not a trustworthy group member at all.~
@2998 = ~Then go, iblith, and check the traps yourself! I trust <CHARNAME> will see which of us is more competent.~
@2999 = ~Can you think of anything besides turning alive and dead people in?~
@3000 = ~Such is my profession, my friend. You've yet to see the whole of it.~
@3001 = ~(snort) I cannot wait.~
@3002 = ~There is darkness all around. Talk to me of past times, Xan.~
@3003 = ~But you remember, and so do I. Why share words, when we can share memories?~
@3004 = ~To think of it, why talk at all?~
@3005 = ~Words have calming effect, while memories do not. I need it.~
@3006 = ~Because I love the sound of your voice.~
@3007 = ~We'll share memories this eve. Now... talk to me.~
@3008 = ~Exactly. Now come. It is dark and dangerous and highly unpleasant. The sooner you see the sunlight, the better.~
@3009 = ~<CHARNAME>, stop looking at me like this! I...~
@3010 = ~<CHARNAME>, I do not want to calm you down with lies. You know that you do not deserve it, do you?~
@3011 = ~Which is flattering, of course, but...~
@3012 = ~Ah, my eternal bane: your imploring eyes...~
@3013 = ~Oh, very well. I will play along - this time.~
@3014 = ~Do you remember... do you remember the Mayor of Nashkel's face when he saw me, alive and well? Three months had passed... he must have decided I was a ghost.~
@3015 = ~A lovely ghost, at that.~
@3016 = ~Well, you looked like one.~
@3017 = ~I don't remember that.~
@3018 = ~Thank you, melamin.~
@3019 = ~Yes, to my great displeasure. A skeleton-like enchanter is not a successful one.~
@3020 = ~Do I... do I look like a ghost now, by the way? I would hate that, but I probably do. Do I?~
@3021 = ~No, Xan. You look fine.~
@3022 = ~Well, you *are* a bit pale...~
@3023 = ~Yes, you do.~
@3024 = ~No? And you do not remember what happened then?~
@3025 = ~Then a tall, thin man dressed in black approached us with most peculiar words: "I am DEATH come for thee."~
@3026 = ~"Surrender, and thy passage shall be... quicker."~
@3027 = ~Nimbul! He had nice boots, too.~
@3028 = ~Who was it?~
@3029 = ~Hmph. I cannot say I am at all convinced... but very well.~
@3030 = ~As I thought. (sigh) Will this journey ever end?~
@3031 = ~If you were going to answer: "in the grave", please, don't. I know it well enough.~
@3032 = ~Now, what happened then?~
@3033 = ~Ah, so you remember. I thought you would. With all the loot we gathered from him, you were bound to.~
@3034 = ~An Iron Throne assassin. There were many of them, alas. I am so happy that you are still with me... (sigh) If not for long.~
@3035 = ~Then... then we found the bandit camp. Strength and guile combined, we got into Tazok's tent, and found an elven prisoner there.~
@3036 = ~Heh, the Iron Throne leaders had a thing for elves, if you ask me.~
@3037 = ~He was so small and helpless... he reminded me of you.~
@3038 = ~Well, we killed them all and freed him. Or did we kill him, too?~
@3039 = ~Yes, I remember.~
@3040 = ~(gulp) I certainly hope not.~
@3041 = ~(snort) Flattered, I am sure. Honestly, <CHARNAME>, you could at least spare my dignity.~
@3042 = ~<CHARNAME>... (sigh) Is murder all you can think of?~
@3043 = ~I know you do.~
@3044 = ~Then... the Cloakwood mines, Baldur's Gate, the Undercity, and then... then... then...~
@3045 = ~Irenicus.~
@3046 = ~Then came our good-byes.~
@3047 = ~Don't continue. I remember, too.~
@3048 = ~Shhh... Don't think of this beast just yet. Come here.~
@3049 = ~And new beginnings...~
@3050 = ~It shall be as you say, of course. Always.~
@3051 = ~Memories are dangerous. I look at you and recall other days... other life. But it is nice to know we have a place called 'past' to escape from the cruel 'now', is it?~
@3052 = ~Now - finally - come. The Underdark awaits.~
@3053 = ~Hey, Xan, do you remember the old times?~
@3054 = ~What should I remember?~
@3055 = ~Why, the Cloakwood mines. Remember how you were afraid to go inside?~
@3056 = ~The bandit camp. They didn't like us entering Tazok's tent and stealing all his documents, eh?~
@3057 = ~The city of Baldur's Gate. Inns, shops, the Iron Throne compound...~
@3058 = ~Do you remember Candlekeep? I took you there, didn't I?~
@3059 = ~Nothing. Never mind.~
@3060 = ~As you wish, then.~
@3061 = ~And you would be, if you spent months in a damp cave. It is not a refreshing experience. Far from it.~
@3062 = ~You are a Greycloak. You should have gotten used to it long ago.~
@3063 = ~Yes, of course. I am sorry.~
@3064 = ~But anyway, we went inside and killed that Davaeorn fellow! Remember, Xan? Even his teleportation magic did not help!~
@3065 = ~It is impossible to get used to *this*. Will you ever get used to the idea that you are going to die? I think not.~
@3066 = ~Never mind. You have never been imprisoned, so... oh. Of course you have. Irenicus... I am sorry.~
@3067 = ~But yes. We killed Davaeorn, we - ~
@3068 = ~Flooded the mines and killed everyone inside, including slaves.~
@3069 = ~Flooded the mines and freed slaves. Davaeorn's people were killed.~
@3070 = ~Returned the way we came. Through Cloakwood forest, Friendly Arm Inn and Wyrm's Crossing - to Baldur's Gate.~
@3071 = ~Which was cruel to the extreme. The guards chose their fate themselves, but the slaves were helpless. It was base, <CHARNAME>, utterly base.~
@3072 = ~Which was cruel to the extreme. The guards chose their fate themselves, but still, it did not sit well with me... and doesn't.~
@3073 = ~Yes... to Baldur's Gate...~
@3074 = ~Regardless, we went to Baldur's Gate.~
@3075 = ~No, they did not. And, to tell you the truth, I did not, either. The poisoned arrows nearly killed me!~
@3076 = ~What? These pathetic archers? Hey, the task was easy as pie!~
@3077 = ~And me, too. I wonder how we are still alive!~
@3078 = ~Poor Xan. But now you've got proper spells to protect yourself.~
@3079 = ~You would say so, wouldn't you? (sigh) When will it all stop being a game to you?~
@3080 = ~Some deity regards us as a source of amusement, perhaps? (sigh) If so, judging by the risks and unpredictability of our situation, the deity is female.~
@3081 = ~Much good does it do me. No, no, my life is forfeit. I just don't pay attention to it any longer.~
@3082 = ~I did not like the city. But in the evenings, when the noise died down, and the lights were low, it was almost... passable.~
@3083 = ~Xan, just say you liked the city at night! There's nothing shameful about it, you know.~
@3084 = ~I liked Baldur's Gate at night, too. I used to sit on the bench with a mug of ale, and breathe the salty see air...~
@3085 = ~I liked it during the day, as well. The carnival, the marketplace, the estates, the museums - it was incredibly entertaining!~
@3086 = ~I did not like it, either. Remember the sewers?~
@3087 = ~It could have been the best time in my life, if not for my enemies.~
@3088 = ~Still, I am hesitant. If I do, we'll get lost in reminiscing, and heavens know how this may end. In another ambush, probably.~
@3089 = ~A few times, yes. I remember. I wonder what happened to the benches in Athkatla, though. The parapet in the Temple District is just not good enough.~
@3090 = ~You forget that it had been your first big city. Naturally, you were impressed.~
@3091 = ~(cough) I do. Thank you kindly for reminding me, though. Now my nightmares will be complete.~
@3092 = ~True, alas. You may comfort yourself with the thought that they are all dead, however. If some madman is not about to resurrect Sarevok, that is.~
@3093 = ~Oh, you did. And I heard a thrilling story about you... er, running around... in some inappropriate clothing.~
@3094 = ~Those fellows! They shouldn't have told you that!~
@3095 = ~Yes, I remember. Awful, wasn't it?~
@3096 = ~Well, we all were young and carefree some time ago.~
@3097 = ~Why, are you ashamed of this? Don't be. Your heritage is much more dark and shameful - but then again, why should you be ashamed of something you had no part in?~
@3098 = ~No, not at all. Why, it was rather sweet.~
@3099 = ~Indeed we were. But I beg of you, do not ask me of *my* carefree side. I do not think I can stand it.~
@3100 = ~You are partly mortal, so all these little things - doubts, flaws, shameful memories - apply to you. You are a child of a god, but you have another, earthy side.~
@3101 = ~And an attractive one, at that.~
@3102 = ~(sigh) I did not want to remind you of Gorion's letter, so I decided to talk about your... mmm... childhood habits, instead. You do not want to recall bad memories now: you need strength and focus. As always, though.~
@3103 = ~Enough. We really should go now, <CHARNAME>. Your destiny awaits... and my death.~
@3104 = ~Again! Xan, can you say ANYTHING ELSE instead of "We're all doomed?"~
@3105 = ~Yes, yes, my heart bleeds for you. Shall we?~
@3106 = ~You - will - not - die. There. I said this again. Happy now?~
@3107 = ~Let's go.~
@3108 = ~What is the point?~
@3109 = ~But of course. Lead on.~
@3110 = ~Why should I be? Your words have no power.~
@3111 = ~But thank you for them.~
@3112 = ~Yes. And - thank you. For this... distraction.~
@3113 = ~Xan, you and I... do you remember?~
@3114 = ~What is there to remember, <CHARNAME>? A few looks, a few words... which I would like to forget. Wouldn't you?~
@3115 = ~But why would you remind me of this? Do you wish me to leave?~
@3116 = ~Maybe. Would you?~
@3117 = ~I thought that you and I could start again. Could we?~
@3118 = ~No, no. Never mind.~
@3119 = ~But of course: your wish is my command. Just say the word.~
@3120 = ~Of course not. No second chances for the doomed. Besides, the reason still stands: you have no part in the Elven Spirit, and thus, you will forever remain a stranger.~
@3121 = ~You will forget this unfortunate affair. Trust me.~
@3122 = ~Besides, we are friends, <CHARNAME>. I will support you however I can. Perhaps in the end, it will matter more than a small, insignificant and hurtful relationship, no?~
@3123 = ~But now I suggest that we move on.~
@3124 = ~Now, Bodhi. You disposed of her, and took the Lanthorn.~
@3125 = ~Do you remember the night when we... mmm... woke up with a severe hangover?~
@3126 = ~We are together. It happened so fast...~
@3127 = ~Yes, I do.~
@3128 = ~And?~
@3129 = ~What about repeating it?~
@3130 = ~I just thought I'd ask. I remember, too.~
@3131 = ~It was intense. Very intense. And wonderful.~
@3132 = ~So, do you want it to continue?~
@3133 = ~Then you won't refuse if I ask you to repeat it?~
@3134 = ~Yes, wonderful...~
@3135 = ~What exactly? The hangover or the night?~
@3136 = ~Both.~
@3137 = ~The night, definitely.~
@3138 = ~The hangover, I guess.~
@3139 = ~(sigh) Come here.~
@3140 = ~You will wait until we are done with Irenicus, will you? Please, do.~
@3141 = ~No. I told you once, and will do so again: no.~
@3142 = ~Not now.~
@3143 = ~(sigh) Trust me, <CHARNAME>, I am not eager to repeat it. I am a mage, not a drunkard, though you seem eager on making me one.~
@3144 = ~Come, or we will be late for the next battle.~
@3145 = ~Indeed. May I remind you whose fault it was?~
@3146 = ~Fault?!~
@3147 = ~I thought you were all for it.~
@3148 = ~Mine, of course.~
@3149 = ~Yours. If not for your gorgeous looks, I would never...~
@3150 = ~<CHARNAME>, you are a hopeless flatterer.~
@3151 = ~Melamin, I am grateful for your confession. If not for it, I wouldn't be so much happier. If only we had more time...~
@3152 = ~We will have time, Xan. All the time in the world.~
@3153 = ~Never mind. You are happy, and this is enough for me.~
@3154 = ~A pity, that.~
@3155 = ~You are so incredibly and charmingly naive...~
@3156 = ~But are you happy?~
@3157 = ~Of course. I am with you.~
@3158 = ~No... not really.~
@3159 = ~I don't know.~
@3160 = ~A pity. But happiness never comes without regrets, now, does it?~
@3161 = ~(sigh) It is too good to be true... and too good to last.~
@3162 = ~I should have known. So much has come to pass... but it will be over soon. With my death, if nothing else, but you will be free... some day.~
@3163 = ~Xan, what do others think of our relationship?~
@3164 = ~Our relationship? Do we have one?~
@3165 = ~I think so.~
@3166 = ~Yes. Don't we?~
@3167 = ~No, probably not. Never mind.~
@3168 = ~I'd venture a guess that some do not view it entirely favorably, if you know what I mean - and you do. Think on it, and think well.~
@3169 = ~Ah. You mean my other suitors, don't you?~
@3170 = ~Now I regret that I ever asked the question.~
@3171 = ~I am sure that I don't understand what you are talking about.~
@3172 = ~Very well, I will.~
@3173 = ~(sigh) But of course.~
@3174 = ~Yes, well... you can always send everyone to the Nine Hells and do whatever you choose. I would prefer, however, that you made your choices carefully. Too much depends on you these days.~
@3175 = ~Indeed? I highly doubt it. Just look around.~
@3176 = ~I cannot say. Are they happy for us? Jealous? Full of pity?~
@3177 = ~Or simply indifferent.~
@3178 = ~There might be some jealousy, but I am not sure.~
@3179 = ~We have gone through much, and we are still together. They probably admire that.~
@3180 = ~Can they be whispering behind our backs?~
@3181 = ~I don't know, either. But I'd like to.~
@3182 = ~Perhaps. Come to think of it, it is the most natural state of things.~
@3183 = ~Oh, but around you, there always will be. Your company is consuming, and you know this.~
@3184 = ~As well they should. It is a miracle that we are still alive.~
@3185 = ~I hope not. But in the city where everyone is whispering behind your back, does it make any difference?~
@3186 = ~My curious <CHARNAME>...~
@3187 = ~Why do you care? Does it matter this much to you?~
@3188 = ~Of course. They are my companions, after all. We live and die together.~
@3189 = ~My friends' opinions are always important to me.~
@3190 = ~Not really. I am simply curious.~
@3191 = ~I could not care less.~
@3192 = ~But does it give them any right to discuss your private affairs? No, and neither do they do so. You are our leader, not an object of gossip.~
@3193 = ~Then ask them some time. I doubt you will get a coherent answer, though.~
@3194 = ~Then do not let it bother you. It is not important enough. I would rather worry about the group's morale.~
@3195 = ~Morale?! You are the one who constantly drags our spirits down!~
@3196 = ~Look who is talking about morale! You complain twice as much as any other!~
@3197 = ~Morale. Why, perhaps. Thank you.~
@3198 = ~Yes, yes, of course. Never mind.~
@3199 = ~In any case, I am with you, and I will remain with you until the end of my conscious days. Whatever they might think. This, I'm afraid, is the best answer I can give.~
@3200 = ~Hmm? Do I really?~
@3201 = ~<CHARNAME>...~ [O#XAN000]
@3202 = ~Yes?~
@3203 = ~Xan, we are in HELL! Leave small talk for later, will you?~
@3204 = ~It had better be important.~
@3205 = ~I am well aware this place is no Garden of Earthy Delights, thank you. But I have to ask for your attention. If I don't say it now, I - I do not think I'll pluck the courage ever again.~ 
@3206 = ~<CHARNAME>, I will not desert you. You are one of the Children, but first and foremost, you are my companion and friend - although, yes, this friendship has been brutally challenged over the last days. There is much conflict in you, but there is also good. And I owe it to this good in you to stay... if you will have me. Will you?~
@3207 = ~Of course. Good of you to change your mind.~
@3208 = ~But what of your task? Evereska must know that Bodhi is dead.~
@3209 = ~Xan, I am just so tired of your moods and changes of heart...~
@3210 = ~(sigh) I understand. I probably won't surprise you if I say I am tired of them, too. But this decision - this is my last and final choice. I will not betray a friend. I will not betray myself.~ 
@3211 = ~Suldanessellar keeps steady connections with Evereska. One of their messengers will carry the news home. Of course, if Irenicus beats us here, the question becomes irrelevant.~
@3212 = ~I should apologize. You saved my life more than once, brought me alive through many horrible places, and in the meanwhile, I was doing nothing but complaining about our doomed task. It still *is* doomed - do not think I am not taking it lightly. But - there is hope. In your face, in our company - while we stand together, we are united.~
@3213 = ~At least, I would like to hope so. Now... shall we?~
@3214 = ~Right. Myahahaha, Irenicus, beware!~
@3215 = ~Why not? We are doomed anyway.~
@3216 = ~No. I prefer to die chatting.~
@3217 = ~Of course, of course. I am sure he is trembling already.~
@3218 = ~(sigh)~
@3219 = ~Indeed, but - ~
@3220 = ~Ah, <CHARNAME>, don't you understand? After these trials, after ending up here, I finally, tremendously, want to live. Of course, here 'living' means 'fighting by your side for the next two minutes and then dropping dead', but I am willing to risk it. Come, we may yet make it.~
@3221 = ~Well, I hate to admit this, but I actually prefer to live. So - get us out of here alive, if you will.~
@3222 = ~A friend asked his moonblade to kill him, to escape a vampire's clutches. Is there any hope for him?~
@3223 = ~A moonfighter's blade killed him. Can I bring him back to life?~
@3224 = ~Moonblades were created by Corellon himself, and bend to his will. Without Corellon's blessing, the blade would not harm its faithful wielder.~
@3225 = ~There is no way to bring him back to life, unless Corellon wishes it. And for the past few centuries, no moonblade wielder ever returned.~
@3226 = ~I am sorry, my good woman. There is no cure.~
@3227 = ~Perhaps you will find consolation that his soul is now in peace, since no moonblade can use its power to kill its wielder and survive. Take heart in this. We all must, for we are all elves and mourn our brother.~
@3228 = ~<CHARNAME>, I suggest we inquire about Taira's father later, when things have... settled a bit.~
@3229 = ~No doubt Talassans have taken care of the poor child's father already. I simply do not know how to bring the news to her...~ [O#XAN271]
@3230 = ~Why did she approach *you*, anyway?~
@3231 = ~He might still be alive.~
@3232 = ~Why do you care so much?~
@3233 = ~"Child, your father is dead. I am sorry. Here is some coin for you." It happened more than once already.~
@3234 = ~Xan, stop it! Let's go and actually check on her father, first.~
@3235 = ~Yes, you are right. Let us enter the temple.~
@3236 = ~Haven't you heard her? She noticed a moonblade strapped to my belt, and probably thought I was one of these legendary heroes who right the wrongs and live by the book. Or she simply had no one else to turn to.~
@3237 = ~(sigh) Come to think of it, the latter is far more likely. Regardless, she is in for a disappointment, I'm afraid.~
@3238 = ~He might be alive - and insane. Would you prefer an insane father, or a dead one?~
@3239 = ~(sigh) I am sorry... I am sorry. I spoke without thinking again.~
@3240 = ~I do not know. Probably because I never encountered any elven children on their own, away from the elven settlements. It is not natural, it is not... right.~
@3241 = ~And still I cannot get used to it. Especially when the child is one of the People.~
@3242 = ~Why would a man take his child with him, while adventuring? It is pure foolishness. He should have expected the child would be solely dependant on him, should he not?~
@3243 = ~He should have. I really do not understand this.~
@3244 = ~Sometimes this is the only way to teach the child of the ways of the world.~
@3245 = ~Adventurers are different, you know this.~
@3246 = ~Would you have done differently, were it your child?~
@3247 = ~What if the girl was human? Would you care then?~
@3248 = ~I will be sure to ask him, if he still lives.~
@3249 = ~I do not think Gorion would agree.~
@3250 = ~Have you met many adventurers who had children? Bar Coran, of course?~
@3251 = ~When the alternative is either locking myself in for decades, like Gorion did, or not seeing my child for months of time? (sigh) A difficult question, <CHARNAME>, but I think I would have done in Gorion's stead.~
@3252 = ~But I have never considered having children of my own; after all, what kind of parent am I likely to be? So, I suppose I have no right to berate this man; rather, to help him as I should. Come, <CHARNAME>, let us go.~
@3253 = ~Elven children mature more slowly. She is more naive and helpless than you think. Besides, I felt kinship of sorts with her; almost as if she was my child.~
@3254 = ~So, it is done. A happy... reunion.~ [O#XAN272]
@3255 = ~Somehow, you do not sound happy at all.~
@3256 = ~Yes. Beautiful, isn't it?~
@3257 = ~Some day we will be in their place. Peaceful, and heading home.~
@3258 = ~I hope he has learnt his lesson.~
@3259 = ~Yes, yes. Let us just move on.~
@3260 = ~(sigh) Of course.~
@3261 = ~I do not think he has come to his senses, yet. One might say he is young, and has a chance to learn, but death will reach him far earlier than the other... instructors.~
@3262 = ~I wouldn't be so pessimistic.~
@3263 = ~If worse comes to worst, there are heroes around. Like us.~
@3264 = ~True. They are doomed.~
@3265 = ~I do not think so, no.~
@3266 = ~I do not think this young man will live to see his child grow. Yes, we helped him this time, but who knows who will ambush them on their way? And as for us... yes, we are the heroes, we protect people, but who will protect the heroes? We will die long before our retirement comes.~
@3267 = ~I believe I told you already: I am not going to retire.~
@3268 = ~Xan, we are NOT doomed. Just like that.~
@3269 = ~Let us enjoy the day and the deed, then.~
@3270 = ~But would you want it? A home, a family, a child in your arms?~
@3271 = ~It matters not. You will not retire either way: death will come first. You know this well enough; you simply choose not to see it.~
@3272 = ~And yet we will die today, or tomorrow, at best. Just like that.~
@3273 = ~The best we can do. You are wise, as always.~
@3274 = ~I do not think I can imagine myself in his place, even if I had the chance. Or you. Sometimes I feel we are just... different. Perhaps someone indeed has to suffer for others to lead a so-called 'happy life'... ?~
@3275 = ~Not a chance! I want my happiness, too.~
@3276 = ~That would be too cruel, Xan.~
@3277 = ~Perhaps. I am willing to suffer for that.~
@3278 = ~See what you think in ten years.~
@3279 = ~Alas, our wishes matter little.~
@3280 = ~(sigh) You are a nobler soul than me, <CHARNAME>.~
@3281 = ~Did you mean "what your corpse will think in ten years"? I have to disappoint you: nothing. Not - a - thing.~
@3282 = ~But come. Indulging such thoughts is futile to the extreme. It is... good to know that our mission is complete, however.~
@3283 = ~It appears that things are more lasting than their owners. Poor Khalid and Dynaheir's fates show it quite well.~ [O#XAN273]
@3284 = ~Yes, I would rather have them back than your robe.~
@3285 = ~Do not remind me. It hurts enough as it is.~
@3286 = ~Xan, stop it! Just be quiet.~
@3287 = ~I would prefer to see one of them in your place, to be honest.~
@3288 = ~Yes, but we rarely have our wishes granted, do we? Though I admit, I was wistfully happy to see my old robe, even if I'd much rather shake Khalid's hand.~
@3289 = ~I am sorry, <CHARNAME>. I was saddened by their deaths, as well, even if it does not show.~
@3290 = ~(sigh) Your manners and tact are impeccable, as always.~
@3291 = ~Why do we lead this life? Why do we doom ourselves? No, no, do not answer. I just wanted to ramble again. Perhaps it is best if we just go.~
@3292 = ~Just know that I am with you, no matter what comes.~
@3293 = ~Of course, Xan. I understand.~
@3294 = ~Let us go, then.~
@3295 = ~No, go on. I do not mind.~
@3296 = ~For how long, <CHARNAME>?~
@3297 = ~Thank you. If there is luck in this world, I am lucky to be in your company.~
@3298 = ~No, it is futile. Besides, when did the small talk ever bring back the dead?~
@3299 = ~(sigh) Perfect. Just perfect. I suppose I should feel honored now?~ [O#XAN274]
@3300 = ~How do you feel?~
@3301 = ~I am sorry it happened, Xan.~
@3302 = ~Wow. You are popular, my dear.~
@3303 = ~You got off easy, that's all I can say.~
@3304 = ~Did you tell the truth to her? You really can't?~
@3305 = ~You are a very good liar, do you know that?~
@3306 = ~Horrible. As well as can be expected.~
@3307 = ~As am I, <CHARNAME>.~
@3308 = ~<CHARNAME>, your humor is disturbing, to say the least. Would you like this kind of popularity?~
@3309 = ~Quite. I was sure I was doomed. I still am, of course.~
@3310 = ~<CHARNAME>...~
@3311 = ~Why would you want to know? You, of all people, here, of all places?~
@3312 = ~(sigh) Never you mind.~
@3313 = ~Rather, she was not good enough in deciphering it. And, Seldarine, how grateful I am...~
@3314 = ~What could have happened... would have been intolerable. But just standing there between you two, unable as much as to raise my eyes from the ground... I suppose I now know what the cattle feels.~
@3315 = ~And yet you eat meat.~
@3316 = ~So much for "thank you".~
@3317 = ~"Us two"? Will you compare her to me now?~
@3318 = ~I know, it must have been unpleasant.~
@3319 = ~Do you think I should have stood there equally numb?~
@3320 = ~I had to interfere, Xan. I had to defend you!~
@3321 = ~And practice domination spells. Yes, <CHARNAME>, I am no saint, and I know this only too well. But there must be a line, mustn't there?~
@3322 = ~No... no. Under no circumstances I will. Whatever your heritage and behavior.~
@3323 = ~It was. And not for me alone, I'd wager.~
@3324 = ~I am thankful. But I am not used to such treatment, nor do I want to get accustomed to it. Nor do I wish to be claimed as property.~
@3325 = ~My complaints are futile, of course. I probably should have let the incident wash over us, forget it and never bring it again. Such helplessness...~
@3326 = ~Forgive me. You are the one who should complain here. Stranded in the Underdark, without a soul, disguised and surrounded by drow - ~
@3327 = ~ - abandoned by the one I love.~
@3328 = ~ - distanced from the one I love.~
@3329 = ~ - and doomed!~
@3330 = ~Yes, I see your point. Apology accepted.~
@3331 = ~Indeed. Compared to this, a night with a drow priestess is just a minor inconvenience.~
@3332 = ~(sigh) <CHARNAME>... there is nothing I can do.~
@3333 = ~I know. But the circumstances demand it from us. When we are free, then...~
@3334 = ~(snort) The end will come sooner than you think, mark my words.~
@3335 = ~I am grateful.~
@3336 = ~I wouldn't call it such, but yes, in the essence you are correct.~
@3337 = ~Speaking of your troubles makes mine lessen, as always. How is it that you always lighten my heart? Must be some ancient magic, from the times well before Bhaal... and perhaps Corellon and Ao...~
@3338 = ~Eternal magic.~
@3339 = ~And yet it wasn't enough, was it?~
@3340 = ~Oooh. Shall we continue this discussion in a more... private atmosphere?~
@3341 = ~Indeed. Let us away from here at last, shall we?~
@3342 = ~(sigh) Indeed.~
@3343 = ~For someone else, it will be.~
@3344 = ~Forgive my bluntness, but just thinking about this side of life brings shudders to my spine and mind both. Let us stop here, shall we?~
@3345 = ~I have to ask you: if at all possible, do not lead us here again. I do not think my luck will hold.~
@3346 = ~Of course. I am sorry for my rambling, I was somewhat... incoherent. Let us leave this place, and preferably never visit here again, if we can help it.~
@3347 = ~And...~
@3348 = ~Thank you.~
@3349 = ~What? Leave me be.~
@3350 = ~There's not enough ale for two here, friend.~
@3351 = ~Speak to Azag. He is our leader.~
@3352 = ~My lord... please, help me!~
@3353 = ~An elven child, here? Seldarine, what brings you to Athkatla, and where are your parents?~
@3354 = ~My mother died, long ago. Please, my father is in danger, and I am all alone!~
@3355 = ~So I see. Perhaps you will tell us more?~
@3356 = ~I am Taira. We traveled with my father. He is a mage, and teaches me to be one! And he also collects old things.~
@3357 = ~Old things? Oh, no, no, no, don't let it be - ~
@3358 = ~He calls them 'artifacts'.~
@3359 = ~(sigh) As I thought. And one or more of them undoubtedly proved to be cursed.~
@3360 = ~Eh... how do you know?~
@3361 = ~Believe me, child, I just do. So which one was it?~
@3362 = ~A tenday ago, my father found an idol... and went all strange. He dropped his pack and started walking south, and I had to run after him all the time, with his things and mine. It was so hard...~
@3363 = ~Shhh... I understand. And what happened then?~
@3364 = ~We were in this city, and then I lost him somewhere... here. I don't know...~
@3365 = ~(sigh) I see.~
@3366 = ~And then I saw you, with a shining moonblade and all, and - you will help me? Won't you? And everything will be all right?~
@3367 = ~Poor thing. I am sure we can think of something, c-can't we?~
@3368 = ~We must find this child's father! And give him a mighty kick of Goodness, so he will know that leaving the little girl alone is Evil!~
@3369 = ~Ask her what idol that was, Xan.~
@3370 = ~<CHARNAME>, will you stop for every damsel in distress? Every drow child is able to fend for themselves. If this darthiir is weak, she will die with or without your help. Leave her to find her strength.~
@3371 = ~Should <CHARNAME> have left you on a pyre, then, to find your strength? Somehow, I doubt you would answer "yes".~
@3372 = ~Bah! Do whatever you wish, then. See how much closer it will bring you to your goal.~
@3373 = ~Everything is *never* all right, but I will do what I can. Child, what was this idol called?~
@3374 = ~Ko-zah. Kozah... my father was repeating it all the way.~
@3375 = ~Minsc remembers! The evil idol of the evil god! If not for wise Boo, Minsc could fall, too!~
@3376 = ~I know the name. The unnatural idol we encountered on our travels bore it. Undoubtedly it fell to some unfortunate soul to discover it again. I told you to hide it well, <CHARNAME>!~
@3377 = ~Kozah... do you remember, <CHARNAME>?~
@3378 = ~Of course I do! Poor Charleston's people, plagued by the curse.~
@3379 = ~I still wonder how we managed to stay alive.~
@3380 = ~Yes, you were quite unhappy when I took the idol with me.~
@3381 = ~Kozah? No, doesn't sound familiar.~
@3382 = ~Yes, I did not enjoy the day, either. Was one of my worst experiences, in fact.~
@3383 = ~More than unhappy. At least one good thing came out of your capture: you no longer possess the thing. (sigh) Though the good things never overweigh the bad...~
@3384 = ~Kozah is an old god of storms and destruction. He promotes self-serving and demands utter obedience from his priests. He is also known as Talos.~
@3385 = ~Talos! The girl's father must be in Talos' temple!~
@3386 = ~And coincidentally, there's a Talos temple just around the corner...~
@3387 = ~Talos? I have no desire to anger the Storm Lord, thank you very much!~
@3388 = ~To go there right after stealing the amulet? We should wait at least a day!~
@3389 = ~So, what do we do?~
@3390 = ~Indeed. We should head there, <CHARNAME>.~
@3391 = ~Except that we, ah, recently visited the temple, so it might be not the best idea to visit it *right now*. Perhaps we should wait a day, lest the Storm Knights recognize us?~
@3392 = ~Please, my lord, find my father! I love him so very much...~
@3393 = ~(sigh) Why is it that heroes are never told these simple words?~
@3394 = ~You had all desire in the world a year ago, when you angered - how many deities? Starting with your own sire.~
@3395 = ~But I apologize. If you do not have time now, considering the predicament you are in, it is more than understandable. I hope we will visit Talos' temple when we have the time, however.~
@3396 = ~I concur. The child needs help, <CHARNAME>. Where would you be now, if you did not have Gorion?~
@3397 = ~I suppose Talos' temple will be a good place to start. If you are willing to help the child, of course.~
@3398 = ~(sigh) Yes, you are likely correct. I am sorry, but you will have to wait for a day, Taira. Have you anywhere to stay?~
@3399 = ~It is warm here... and the kind priest gave me food, so I'm alright. Just find my father, please. I love him so very much...~
@3400 = ~I am here on behest of a little elven girl, Taira. She wants her father back.~
@3401 = ~What foul curse befell the elf in your halls? Release him at once!~
@3402 = ~We still haven't found the culprits. Where do we look for them?~
@3403 = ~We recovered the Storm Ring. Here it is.~
@3404 = ~The little madman? He is not incapacitated. His foolishness led him here, and we are not intent on letting him stay. However, releasing him from the Storm Lord's hold is costly.~
@3405 = ~How much?~
@3406 = ~What is the price?~
@3407 = ~Forget it. I am not interested.~
@3408 = ~Search the filth. The slums, the taverns - the more depraved, the better. The thieves will be there. The one we punished mentioned the Copper Coronet.~
@3409 = ~Excellent. The geas is lifted, and you can find the elf in the back rooms. See to him - he is likely disoriented and helpless. Go; do not disturb me further.~
@3410 = ~Several days ago, some imbeciles broke into my chambers and stole the Storm Ring - Talos' relic. One of them was captured and executed, but he did not have the relic. The others managed to escape.~
@3411 = ~We blamed Lathanderites, and took steps to punish them accordingly. But the thief revealed he was a part of a simple mercenary band, in no one's employ. They were going to steal the relic, and sell it to someone in the Copper Coronet.~
@3412 = ~Find them, kill them, and bring the ring to me. I will lift the geas on the elf in return.~
@3413 = ~I am not interested in his freedom. Will I get anything else?~
@3414 = ~Consider it done.~
@3415 = ~Why can't you go after them yourself?~
@3416 = ~As you should be. However, I do not want you coming here, declaring you have changed your mind, and disturbing me again. So, you will listen to me now.~
@3417 = ~You will be paid accordingly. Now go, and search the taverns. They should still be in the city.~
@3418 = ~(sigh) Another hopeless task, and, as always, no choice...~
@3419 = ~The cult below has been stealing our members. We do not have enough resources.~
@3420 = ~Kozah itet! Ktul tot gor Kozah! Mast is Kozah!~
@3421 = ~The priestess... tell...~
@3422 = ~KOZAH!!~
@3423 = ~(gulp) Perhaps there is no real need to tell the girl of *that*, yet. But only a competent priest of Talos can heal him, <CHARNAME>.~
@3424 = ~Kozah tozh tot! Na hag Kozah!! Ula do Kozah!!!~
@3425 = ~I... awaken...~
@3426 = ~Taira! My daughter... the pain... her passing...~
@3427 = ~She is dead... is she not? Did I kill her in my madness? No matter. Thank you for freeing me, whoever you are, but my life is worth nothing now. Goodbye.~
@3428 = ~Where... where am I?~
@3429 = ~(sigh) Why do they always ask that?~
@3430 = ~Oh... a moonblade wielder? My lord, I am honored...~
@3431 = ~Most importantly, you are free. Incidentally, do you remember that you have a daughter?~
@3432 = ~My daughter! Taira! Where is she? Oh, Corellon, what happened to us?~
@3433 = ~Taira is well and safe. She asked us to find you, and we did.~
@3434 = ~You were under influence of a cursed idol.~
@3435 = ~Talos' will enslaved you. You are free now.~
@3436 = ~Give up all your valuables, and I'll tell you.~
@3437 = ~Nothing, except that I am going to kill you. Now.~
@3438 = ~Is she here? Where is she? Please, do not torment me - where is my daughter?~
@3439 = ~At least, he came to his senses. (sigh) But somehow, I do not feel relieved.~
@3440 = ~You remembered about her a touch too late, don't you think?~
@3441 = ~Please, I am going mad...~
@3442 = ~She is outside.~
@3443 = ~Not far from here. Come, I will lead you.~
@3444 = ~She is waiting for you in the streets.~
@3445 = ~I am not going to tell you, unless you pay me.~
@3446 = ~What twisted game is this? I... I do not trust either of you!~
@3447 = ~Praise the gods! Forgive me, but I must see to her, first. I will meet you outside, my saviors.~
@3448 = ~H-hello. Have you found my father already? No?~
@3449 = ~(sigh) You will have to wait a little longer, child.~
@3450 = ~Please... find him, all right? I am sick and scared here.~
@3451 = ~I... I can feel it! He is dead! Father is dead! No...~
@3452 = ~(sob!)~
@3453 = ~Father! Father is here!~
@3454 = ~(cough) Thank you, travelers.~
@3455 = ~And you, my lord.~
@3456 = ~You saved my life, you saved Taira, and for this I will be forever grateful.~
@3457 = ~So grateful that you will stop putting your child in danger?~
@3458 = ~It is of little use to you and your child, if you continue with your irresponsible behavior.~
@3459 = ~I know I was rash and stupid, like a human youngster. But believe me, it will never happen again. We will head somewhere peaceful - to Tethyr, perhaps, or to Saradush.~
@3460 = ~Oooh, Saradush! I want to go there! Can we really?~
@3461 = ~Your help has been most welcome. Please, take this ring as a sign of my utmost gratitude.~
@3462 = ~I am so happy I met you all!~
@3463 = ~(sigh) And we are just so happy... You have no idea. But never mind. Just take care of your daughter, and fare you well.~
@3464 = ~Good luck to you on your journeys.~
@3465 = ~I smell bad news. Who are you, friend?~
@3466 = ~People like that aren't friendly at all...~
@3467 = ~I have a feeling that nobody is *your* friend, friend.~
@3468 = ~Have you stolen the Storm Ring?~
@3469 = ~Mistress Ada offers you a deal: your lives in exchange for the relic you stole.~
@3470 = ~Er... nothing. Just walking by.~
@3471 = ~Walking by again, eh?~
@3472 = ~I know you have stolen the Storm Ring!~
@3473 = ~Return the Talos' relic, thief!~
@3474 = ~Er... yes?~
@3475 = ~So, have you got the money or not? I will not wait forever, you know.~
@3476 = ~Two thousand? Easily! Here.~
@3477 = ~I must have the ring! Give it up or die.~
@3478 = ~One thousand, and we have a deal.~
@3479 = ~I cannot pay the sum you require.~
@3480 = ~I am still undecided.~
@3481 = ~What ring? What relic? Talos? Never heard of him. Why do people keep pestering me about this?~
@3482 = ~(whistles)~
@3483 = ~But... well. If you are serious about the ring, you can buy it from us. Two thousand should do it, eh, boys?~
@3484 = ~You will do nothing of the sort, <CHARNAME>! Even a child can sense that something is not right here. Do not pay, or you will regret it.~
@3485 = ~You open your mouth more often than is healthy for you, friend. Mark my words, one day someone will cure you of this unfortunate habit.~
@3486 = ~(sigh) Yes, my death will, and soon. I am quite aware of that, thank you.~
@3487 = ~Sh-should we pay the thieves? I-I do not like it, <CHARNAME>...~
@3488 = ~This deal does not smell good, my friend.~
@3489 = ~I... I do not like this, <CHARNAME>. And two thousand is a large sum...~
@3490 = ~Would you allow this iblith to jerk you around, <CHARNAME>? Pfeh! I thought better of you.~
@3491 = ~So, adventurers! What say you?~
@3492 = ~Give the relic to me, or be introduced to the Shadow Thieves.~
@3493 = ~I do not have this kind of money with me.~
@3494 = ~Forget it.~
@3495 = ~Forget it, corpse.~
@3496 = ~Keep walking, then.~
@3497 = ~Done! A pleasure to meet a civilized <MANWOMAN> at last. But I've never seen this ring in my life, you understand.~
@3498 = ~Hmm... charming, charming, but no. Two is my last word.~
@3499 = ~Two? Very well, here you go.~
@3500 = ~I do not have this much, sorry.~
@3501 = ~No! I must have the ring! Defend yourself!~
@3502 = ~Aha! Threats! Well, we know how to answer to this one, don't we?~
@3503 = ~And just so you know, we do not have the ring. If only you searched the temples before coming here, Selia could have sold you one. Perhaps. But now it is far, far too late for you to use this knowledge. You will not escape here alive.~
@3504 = ~I hope we will not meet again.~
@3505 = ~You...~
@3506 = ~Exactly.~
@3507 = ~How is it that you are still alive?~
@3508 = ~Nobody deals with me more than once, true. But, on the other hand, there are way too many people who haven't heard of me. You, for example.~
@3509 = ~But you want to know where the ring *is*, correct? Well, in this I can help you, friend. Hmm, I probably should charge you extra... no matter.~
@3510 = ~Selia, our companion, has it. She is still out there in the Temple District, intending to... ah, make more lucrative deals. If you know what I mean. Search the temples. Tell her I sent you.~
@3511 = ~Regardless, we are out of here. Give our greetings to Selia, if she is still alive. She will know where to find us. Come, boys!~
@3512 = ~It was not a pleasure meeting you, believe me.~
@3513 = ~Oh, just get out of my sight!~
@3514 = ~You will not get away with this! Defend yourself!~
@3515 = ~Do you seriously think I will let you go? Ha!~
@3516 = ~Hello. Is there something I can do for you? I am quite busy.~
@3517 = ~Your companion, Azag, mentioned your name.~
@3518 = ~Two words: Storm Ring.~
@3519 = ~We are here to kill you.~
@3520 = ~No, I don't think so.~
@3521 = ~On your way, then.~
@3522 = ~Is there anything else you need?~
@3523 = ~Actually, Azag sent me.~
@3524 = ~The Storm Ring.~
@3525 = ~Nothing. Sorry.~
@3526 = ~If you stopped testing my patience, I would be grateful.~
@3527 = ~Aha. I see. And you have the money with you, of course? I will not settle for less than one thousand gold.~
@3528 = ~You dare?! I paid Azag already!~
@3529 = ~Azag is dead. Do you want to share his fate? This can be arranged.~
@3530 = ~Azag escaped my wrath, but that does not mean you will. Do you understand me?~
@3531 = ~Yes, I do.~
@3532 = ~I do not have the money with me.~
@3533 = ~Either you give me the ring, or the priests of Lathander learn of your purpose here.~
@3534 = ~Oh, but Azag is Azag, and his money is not mine. One thousand, or there is no deal.~
@3535 = ~Then there is no deal, for I will kill you here and now!~
@3536 = ~Here is your damned money, then.~
@3537 = ~I have no choice. I will pay.~
@3538 = ~Do you have a death wish, woman?~
@3539 = ~You may threaten me all you want. I am a mage - one flicker of my hand, and I am out of here. And you need this ring badly, do you not?~
@3540 = ~You may try to kill me, but, trust me, you will not succeed. Neither will you take the ring from my corpse. Just like that.~
@3541 = ~Very good.~
@3542 = ~Yes, the sum seems to be correct. Our deal is concluded. Enjoy!~
@3543 = ~Return later, then, but return soon. I will not be here for long.~
@3544 = ~Well?~
@3545 = ~I have the money now. Here.~
@3546 = ~I still do not have the necessary sum.~
@3547 = ~Well, die!~
@3548 = ~Oh? But being what you are, you must understand how easy it is to fall into the same trap, do you not?~
@3549 = ~Do you wish to steal from *me*? Ha! You are welcome to try.~
@3550 = ~No, Selia. Look at me.~
@3551 = ~What? What is it you - ~
@3552 = ~(sigh) Breaking your mind brings me no pleasure, but two lives of my kin are at stake. You must give us the ring.~
@3553 = ~No... You... stop it!~
@3554 = ~You must give us the ring. If you keep resisting, you will die.~
@3555 = ~I...~
@3556 = ~Damn you! No trinket is worth my life!~
@3557 = ~(sigh) Exactly. Give it up, Selia... give... it... up.~
@3558 = ~Here! Take it and be damned! May you die in agony, may you all die!~
@3559 = ~Decide, then, and decide quickly.~
@3560 = ~Take the money and give me the ring.~
@3561 = ~Do not address me, <MALEFEMALE>. Neither of you holds my interest.~
@3562 = ~I warn you, <MALEFEMALE>. The daughters of the First House do not brook imbeciles. Lolth's angry gaze will fall on you, if you continue to be impertinent.~
@3563 = ~Who ARE you that you would DARE to - ~
@3564 = ~WHAT?! SURFACERS?! DISGUISED IN MAGIC?!! DROW... IN LOLTH'S NAME!! KILL THEM!! KILL THEM!!~
@3565 = ~You, male. Yes, you, in the robes! Come closer. I wish to have a good look at you.~
@3566 = ~(gulp) M-me?~
@3567 = ~Bah, I have no time for this imbecility! Praise Lolth I will not need your brain tonight, or you'd be facing spider pits. Yes, you! You will come before me - now!~
@3568 = ~Xan, just do as she says.~
@3569 = ~Go! Quickly! We may all die because of you!~
@3570 = ~I have a bad feeling about this...~
@3571 = ~Hold it. What gives you the authority to command one of my males?~
@3572 = ~No. This is MY male, and none but I shall touch him.~
@3573 = ~(sigh) At your command, powerful female.~
@3574 = ~Good. I like obedience in a male... hmm, there is more here than just obedience... Most interesting.~
@3575 = ~You - all of you - go. I am pleased with my choice of a male; you will take him back in a few hours, if I am done with him then.~
@3576 = ~As you wish, mistress.~
@3577 = ~And did you bother asking *him*?~
@3578 = ~Who are you to treat him like that?~
@3579 = ~Leave your paws off him! He is mine!~
@3580 = ~And what are you going to do with him?~
@3581 = ~You dare address me as an equal, whereas you are barely more than a slave yourself? Amusing. Yes, I know of you, Veldrin of Ched Nasad, which may be more than you deserve.~
@3582 = ~I am Hunrae of the First House, and this male will go with me. Do I make myself clear?~
@3583 = ~Fair enough. He is just a male, after all.~
@3584 = ~You will be disappointed. He is my property, and will not perform with you.~
@3585 = ~He is not "this male". He is MY male.~
@3586 = ~Of course, take him. I have other males.~
@3587 = ~You are nothing to me, and yet you risk raising your eyes over a mere male?~
@3588 = ~What say you, male? You feel honored to be chosen, of course, and the only obstacle is this impudent female next to you. Tell me, male... do you wish her out of the way?~
@3589 = ~Ah... the House we serve will be most displeased with Veldrin's demise.~
@3590 = ~I see. A conflict with the other house is not in my interests now... unless we settle this debt personally. Bah! I am in no mood for this.~
@3591 = ~Enough of this foolishness. You - male! Go with me. I will tolerate no delay.~
@3592 = ~Th-this is disgusting! Veldrin, d-do something!~
@3593 = ~<CHARNAME>, you cannot - (sigh) There is nothing we can do.~
@3594 = ~Say your last goodbyes to your jaluk - he will not last for long.~
@3595 = ~(sigh) Most powerful female, I... cannot honor your request.~
@3596 = ~What? What do you mean, "cannot"?~
@3597 = ~I, ah... (sigh) Veldrin, will you explain my predicament?~
@3598 = ~Have you no tongue yourself, male? Speak!~
@3599 = ~This is not... possible.~
@3600 = ~Physically.~
@3601 = ~Ah. You do not lie, I see.~
@3602 = ~So why not tell me at once? Your female kept intervening as if you were the best lover in Ched Nasad!~
@3603 = ~Well, she...~
@3604 = ~Bah!~
@3605 = ~Ha ha ha! I should take you and break you in instead of him, for the sheer amusement of it! Your Matron Mother should be flogged for neglecting your education like this!~
@3606 = ~But no; my mind is made up. Go to the lust chambers now, female, and see for yourself what I am going to do to this male before me. I assure you, he will like it.~
@3607 = ~I will not pay.~
@3608 = ~As you wish. I will be here for a short while, yet. Do not disturb me if you have nothing else to say.~
@3609 = ~(sigh) I am sorry, child, but the one who could grant your father freedom can no longer do so. There is nothing we can do.~
@3610 = ~If only I could...~
@3611 = ~I... I do not know you.~
@3612 = ~Taira's father.

I met a girl in the Temple District today. Her father recently stumbled upon an idol of Kozah, also known as Talos, which caused him to go mad. The little girl, Taira, asked me to bring her father back to her.~
@3613 = ~Taira's father.

I encountered Rotan in Talos' temple, raving mad. Perhaps the Weathermistress Ada or some of Talos' clerics can offer help?~
@3614 = ~Taira's father.

Mistress Ada agreed to help Taira's father in return for the Storm Ring. By the words of their dying comrade, the thieves are rumored to frequent the taverns, especially the Copper Coronet.~
@3615 = ~Taira's father.

I found the thieves in the Copper Coronet. Azag, their leader, asked two thousand gold for the ring. Now they all lie dead, save for their companion, Selia, who is still searching the temples. She has the ring.~
@3616 = ~Taira's father.

I found the thieves in the Copper Coronet. Azag, their leader, asked two thousand gold for the ring. I agreed, but they did not have the ring! However, their companion, Selia, has it. She should still be searching the temples.~
@3617 = ~Taira's father.

Selia fled, and now the only opportunity to help Taira and her father is lost. I have done all I could.~
@3618 = ~Taira's father.

Xan made Selia return the ring. We are now ready to return to the Weathermistress Ada and exchange the ring for Rotan's freedom.~
@3619 = ~Taira's father.

Selia sold us the ring. We are now ready to return to the Weathermistress Ada and exchange the ring for Rotan's freedom.~
@3620 = ~Taira's father.

Rotan and Taira are finally together, and our mission is complete. The Ring of Regeneration should more than make for our efforts.~
@3621 = ~(sigh)~ [O#XAN000]
@3622 = ~So, Selia escapes, and we lose. Or, rather, the child does. How does it feel, <CHARNAME>, to rob someone of their father?~
@3623 = ~My Lord! Our... my pursuit was futile. My men found no traces of the drow group.~
@3624 = ~So I see. Most unfortunate.~
@3625 = ~Indeed. I... I assure you we did our utmost.~
@3626 = ~We have little in the way of privacy now, but discuss it we shall. Later.~
@3627 = ~I assure you I did not want - ~
@3628 = ~Later, Ricar.~
@3629 = ~What was that about?~
@3630 = ~A drow group escaped you? Seems you treat fellow surfacers with more hostility than the drow!~
@3631 = ~Never mind me. I'll just go.~
@3632 = ~Nothing of importance, stranger. May I leave?~
@3633 = ~Things are not as they seem, stranger. But I am not going to explain myself to you. May I leave?~
@3634 = ~Wait... Ricar?~
@3635 = ~Who... Xan?~
@3636 = ~(sigh) I should have expected to see you here. We are close to Suldanessellar, after all.~
@3637 = ~Xan of Evereska! How come you are here?~
@3638 = ~(groan) I am sure there is no need to recount *this* story again. <CHARNAME> here has been questioned for long enough already. Suffice is to say we have a mission here.~
@3639 = ~<CHARNAME>? *That* <CHARNAME>? Are you traveling with a Bhaalspawn? Xan, what has become of you?~
@3640 = ~I suggest you choose your words carefully, or not at all. I will not tolerate you slandering her name again.~
@3641 = ~Back in the Academy, you never used this tone. You have changed a great deal, Xan.~
@3642 = ~<CHARNAME> is my companion and friend.~
@3643 = ~You have always been slow to give your friendship. Quite unusual of you.~
@3644 = ~Yes, we have all changed. In any case, how come you are aware of <CHARNAME>'s heritage?~
@3645 = ~I traveled to Athkatla briefly, and heard the rumors. But, considering your companion's heritage... may I ask? <CHARNAME>, are you the infamous... er, the Bhaalspawn who was rumored to have spent some time in Irenicus' capture a while ago?~
@3646 = ~Yes, it was me.~
@3647 = ~I do not like your manner, but you are correct.~
@3648 = ~Why do you ask?~
@3649 = ~I have no time for this.~
@3650 = ~I refuse to cooperate.~
@3651 = ~So, since you were the prisoner of the Ex-~
@3652 = ~But since you were the prisoner of the Ex-~
@3653 = ~Enough.~
@3654 = ~Yes. I... apologize. I said more than I should have.~
@3655 = ~You have done well, regardless. Without you, I would never have thought to ask <CHARNAME> this question.~
@3656 = ~<CHARNAME>, I assure you this is important. If you only stay and help - ~
@3657 = ~<CHARNAME>, you have a crucial mission of your own already. I cannot make you cooperate in this matter, as well, but I am asking you to listen, at least.~
@3658 = ~I... I suppose it is an important matter indeed. Shall we listen to what they have to say? It may delay us for quite a while, however.~
@3659 = ~I suppose it cannot hurt.~
@3660 = ~Very well, I will hear them out.~
@3661 = ~Only because you want me to.~
@3662 = ~No, and this is my final word.~
@3663 = ~The location of your prison is... quite important. I will explain further, if you agree to cooperate. Do you?~
@3664 = ~I do. Tell me more.~
@3665 = ~So be it, then. I agree.~
@3666 = ~No, I have neither the interest nor the time for this.~
@3667 = ~(sigh) Of course. Forgive me for speaking out of turn, my liege.~
@3668 = ~When we gain access to the city, it will be of little importance, regardless. Compared to the Queen's safety, all other matters are secondary.~
@3669 = ~Yes, my liege. It shall be as you say. Xan, I am sorry that our meeting was so short, but we were never especially close, as I recall. Or were we?~
@3670 = ~(sigh) Who can say now? But perhaps we shall meet again. Who knows?~
@3671 = ~Who indeed?~
@3672 = ~We still have some time, however. If you change your mind, Ricar will be here to explain you the details.~
@3673 = ~And good luck - to all of us, for these are dark and troubled times.~
@3674 = ~You are already aware of Suldanessellar's fate, I am sure. We are in need of allies: we require aid, and require it badly. It does not show in our manner - and shouldn't, since Tel'Quessir are a proud race. You know as much yourself.~
@3675 = ~We sent messengers to the human lands. Queen Zaranda of Tethyr is our most probable ally, and we count on her help, despite the events that transpired around a century ago, when King Errilam of Tethyr perished on elven lands.~
@3676 = ~However... My liege, how much should I reveal?~
@3677 = ~I will continue for you.~
@3678 = ~Irenicus is known to us, this you are aware of. You know he is a fiend and a criminal, who would stop before nothing to reach his goals.~
@3679 = ~Whilst he was still... tolerated... here, he had stolen most important documents from the Queen's archives. Do not ask me how; I cannot say more than I have.~
@3680 = ~Who would have allowed him?~
@3681 = ~Need I repeat myself? I cannot say more, even to my kin. Even to you.~
@3682 = ~We have been searching for them all the while, but our search was fruitless. My scouts found more than one abandoned laboratory, but there were no traces of letters, journals or chronicles there, and my men were skilled indeed.~
@3683 = ~However, we never got to the place where he kept you - am I correct in my guess that it was beneath Athkatla? Since it was his last permanent abode, the documents must be there.~
@3684 = ~Or with the drow you so light-heartedly let go.~
@3685 = ~I - I didn't... I was sure they were Eilistraee's followers, and the documents were *not* with them! I shall willingly lay down my life, if I am proved to be wrong!~
@3686 = ~We are all in grave danger. Do not add to it.~
@3687 = ~Perhaps you shall explain who these drow were? As well, why are you so sure Irenicus does not possess these... papers on his person? And why are these papers so important?~
@3688 = ~Some of these... accounts could make our potential allies turn away from us. There was nothing dishonest in our dealings, ever. However, accidents and misunderstandings happened, and if they were known widely... you understand, I hope.~
@3689 = ~So, it makes no sense for Irenicus to take these papers to Suldanessellar: on the contrary, he will use them, and send messengers to our allies, so his revenge is complete.~
@3690 = ~And the only messengers he could use were these drow.~
@3691 = ~Since... they were the only drow whom my men allowed passage, because of their allegiance to the Dark Maiden, Lady Silverhair... no. No, I do not believe it. That we did not find them again does not prove anything.~
@3692 = ~Most probably, these papers are still in his abode. We need your aid, <CHARNAME>. The dungeon's entrance is blocked, as you are probably aware of. But if I and Xan unite in communion for a few seconds, and you open your mind to us but a little - Xan will make sure I will not see more than I am meant to, - I will be able to build a portal that will take us there.~
@3693 = ~I will not stand for this. <CHARNAME> has been through too much already.~
@3694 = ~Not again! I do not want to go there again, <CHARNAME>, do not make me!~
@3695 = ~Khalid... no. No.~
@3696 = ~Boo says we should follow our friends, and help the pretty elves here. But Minsc remembers the place, and how his friend <CHARNAME> was hurting!~
@3697 = ~I hope we shall be able to counter the traps and dangers of this place. I shall be going with you, and Xan can confirm my worth. What say you, <CHARNAME>?~
@3698 = ~I am still confused about these drow you mentioned. Care to tell me more?~
@3699 = ~It is an interesting offer, but we need to rest, first.~
@3700 = ~I agree. Let us travel there immediately.~
@3701 = ~What, am I actually allowed to talk now?~
@3702 = ~No. Bodhi is my first priority.~
@3703 = ~I apologize. I realize you are tired... perhaps this very conversation tired you more than a battle would. But the matter's importance is grave indeed.~
@3704 = ~Come and talk to me again, soon. I suggest you rest and prepare first, but we have little in the way of time, and our supplies and numbers decrease by the hour. We need aid badly.~
@3705 = ~Yes? Are you ready to aid us, <CHARNAME>?~
@3706 = ~I am. Start your spell, and let us return to Irenicus' hideout.~
@3707 = ~I am not sure, but yes. I am ready.~
@3708 = ~Not yet.~
@3709 = ~I shall wait here for a while, yet. But I cannot delay for too long. My kin needs my help below. Make your mind quickly, <CHARNAME>.~
@3710 = ~You have come back! Should I understand that you at least agree to listen?~
@3711 = ~Yes, tell me what the task is.~
@3712 = ~No, this is not the right time.~
@3713 = ~I apologize, <CHARNAME>, but I would prefer to see Xan with you. Not that we distrust you... but seeing you with a moonblade wielder is more... reassuring.~
@3714 = ~I prefer to talk of this later, in private. It seems... it seems that I have committed a grave mistake. Perhaps a crime, even.~
@3715 = ~Untrue, I am sure. You have always been one of the staunchest defenders of the People.~
@3716 = ~Regardless, I have failed.~
@3717 = ~Very well. Xan, take <CHARNAME>'s hand, and I shall take yours. Listen to the Spirit... and I shall build the portal.~
@3718 = ~Here we are - oh, Seldarine...~
@3719 = ~The pain... the hurt... it emanates from every stone...~
@3720 = ~Let us find what we have come here for quickly. I will not tolerate this place longer than necessary.~
@3721 = ~The... the cage where he kept you. Little <PRO_BROTHERSISTER>... do you remember? I will never forget...~
@3722 = ~The evil wizard will enslave people no longer! Boo will go for his eyes, and Minsc's sword will go for his evil belly, and give him a true thrust of Goodness!~
@3723 = ~We shouldn't have returned there... we shouldn't have. Can you... how are you, <CHARNAME>?~
@3724 = ~Hurting.~
@3725 = ~I do not like it here, as you might imagine.~
@3726 = ~Just be here for me, will you?~
@3727 = ~Me? Oh, I am well. I am not sure about the others, however.~
@3728 = ~We will get you out as soon as we can.~
@3729 = ~(He squeezes your hand silently.)~
@3730 = ~Of course. Corellon, you have been through so much...~
@3731 = ~Yes... it must be hard for them, as well. But let us listen to what Ricar has to say.~
@3732 = ~It must have taken a great presence of mind to survive all this... to escape from here. I apologize for thinking so little of you before.~
@3733 = ~But I see but dead bodies and cages here. Where must we go? Xan?~
@3734 = ~His private chambers, I suppose. Or... you look as you have another idea. What is it?~
@3735 = ~I... yes. When we were transporting, I saw a brief vision of a room in <CHARNAME>'s mind... "Her room", it was called. I am certain that if the papers are indeed in this place, they can be only there.~
@3736 = ~But this abode was not his last. What about Spellhold? Or his chambers in Ust Natha?~
@3737 = ~I cannot be sure, but from what I saw in <CHARNAME>'s mind - I apologize, <CHARNAME>, but a very brief insight into your memories was unavoidable, - it seems he abandoned this place in a hurry, unaware that he would never return. If so, we have a chance.~
@3738 = ~Come closer, all of you. I will transport you. Just like good old times, eh, Xan?~
@3739 = ~(sigh) I wish... Take my hand, <CHARNAME>.~
@3740 = ~Here. This is the place.~
@3741 = ~Such splendor...~
@3742 = ~No... not again... My head is about to burst!~
@3743 = ~We shall leave soon, Imoen. As soon as we can, I promise.~
@3744 = ~These letters bear the seal of our Queen, so I shall be able to find them - but you will have to stand very still.~
@3745 = ~Just like the Academy... do you remember, Ricar? The searching enchantments?~
@3746 = ~Ha! You were lucky then - you only had to find your moonblade in the final test. I had to search for my ring, and, trust me, easy it was not. Though perhaps it will help me now... hold on...~
@3747 = ~Wait! This room is heavily trapped. Do you know what kind of guardian may appear, should you find and remove the papers?~
@3748 = ~Proceed as you wish.~
@3749 = ~We searched this room already, and most thoroughly, at that. How can you hope to find anything?~
@3750 = ~A guardian?~
@3751 = ~Indeed...~
@3752 = ~We do not seem to have a choice, however. But be prepared.~
@3753 = ~I was *taught* to search, <CHARNAME>. Weren't you listening? Now, if you please...~
@3754 = ~It is concealed just above the pillow, on the right of... yes. Here.~
@3755 = ~"A'maelamin, cormamin lindua ele lle..."~
@3756 = ~"Mela en' coiamin, lirimaer, amin..."~
@3757 = ~Again... and again... no. They are all the same!~
@3758 = ~Love letters?~
@3759 = ~No! That is... yes, but they are probably of no importance...~
@3760 = ~Indeed, of so little importance that they are most carefully hidden, and the parchment looks decades old. Worthless, I am sure.~
@3761 = ~This is not the point! The real documents are not here! Don't you understand! It means that she must have had them! That she lied to me, and I let her go!~
@3762 = ~Who? Bodhi?~
@3763 = ~Tell me everything from the very beginning.~
@3764 = ~Lied to you? Do you mean that drow woman?~
@3765 = ~No, no. Bodhi stole the Lanthorn. This was her first and only role, I am sure.~
@3766 = ~Yes, you have a perfect memory. I meant her, indeed.~
@3767 = ~I shall, but it is going to be difficult.~
@3768 = ~I used to go on patrol with my men, guarding tunnels not far from the city of Ust Natha. We killed many, and several of our number fell to the dark ones - the hatred was mutual.~
@3769 = ~Not long ago, however, we encountered an unusual group. They looked humble, frightened, and they prayed to Eilistraee - a trait unheard of in any "real" drow.~
@3770 = ~I questioned them extensively, but I was unable to detect any evil in them. Their leader, Hunrae...~
@3771 = ~(gulp) Did I hear the name correctly?~
@3772 = ~Yes, of course. Hunrae. Have you met her in the Underdark?~
@3773 = ~I have, but I would... rather not speak of it. Suffice is to say that yes... she was most definitely... evil.~
@3774 = ~I am sorry, Xan, but I simply cannot believe you. Although considering the recent events... but no. No.~
@3775 = ~Hunrae explained they were Eilistraee's followers, hunted and prosecuted by the other drow. She begged me to let her and her brethren leave, begged me on her knees... She was so beautiful.~
@3776 = ~(sigh) Ricar, Ricar... Did you believe her?~
@3777 = ~I did. I let them go, and even shared what provisions we had with her group. She promised to meet me again in a day, not far from the camp, but she never did... I thought her dead or wounded, and searched for her, but to no avail.~
@3778 = ~Elhan did not believe me, either. Now I see why. He thought me a green youth, unable to tell a friend from foe - and he was right. Ironic, isn't it? Considering I am well past a hundred summers already.~
@3779 = ~(sigh) I make worse mistakes, and I hardly younger. Age does not mean as much as the younger ones think, Ricar. But what are we to do now? Where can these drow be?~
@3780 = ~I think - ~
@3781 = ~No! Who's here?~
@3782 = ~Thieves! He had stolen my soul, and thou wouldst steal my memories? Thy treachery would not go unpunished!~
@3783 = ~Another clone-thing? How many does he have here?~
@3784 = ~(gulp) She is... no. It... it cannot be...~
@3785 = ~Another clone! Attack!~
@3786 = ~What are you waiting for! She is going to utter a spell any minute!~
@3787 = ~Cannot be - what?~
@3788 = ~No! We must leave - we cannot touch her!~
@3789 = ~What is the problem? I killed one of her already!~
@3790 = ~It is just a mindless clone! Let me at her!~
@3791 = ~What? Who the hell is she?~
@3792 = ~What do we do, then?~
@3793 = ~I am sorry, <CHARNAME>, but we are leaving. Now, before more guardians appear and follow us through the portal! Now!~
@3794 = ~Thou shalt not escape!~
@3795 = ~Finally. I was worried it'd follow - ~
@3796 = ~It did.~
@3797 = ~Seldarine... And my spells are worthless...~
@3798 = ~Fly, and report to Elhan, then. And quickly, before we are all doomed!~
@3799 = ~Yes. I should...~
@3800 = ~I am relieved to see you alive, but... where is Xan? Bring him, please.~
@3801 = ~You have come. I do not know if I should feel relieved or anxious...~
@3802 = ~You have established where the documents are, I trust. Now your task is to locate their current owner.~
@3803 = ~My liege... I cannot.~
@3804 = ~I will not allow you to. <CHARNAME> and <PRO_HISHER> esteemed companion will do this, if they are willing. I trust they understand the task's importance well enough.~
@3805 = ~And when they will find her... ?~
@3806 = ~I would like to interrogate the drow, but I know better than to suggest it. The dark ones are vicious, and most likely <CHARNAME> will have no other choice but to kill the entire group.~
@3807 = ~If... if they are indeed guilty, so be it. But, if they are not... if Hunrae is not...~
@3808 = ~(sigh) Ricar, when will you pull your head from the clouds?~
@3809 = ~<CHARNAME> will deal with her as <PRO_HESHE> sees fit, I am sure.~
@3810 = ~Will you... accept the task?~
@3811 = ~I will. But I will not harm these drow, if they are innocent.~
@3812 = ~Drow are drow! They will all fall by my hand!~
@3813 = ~Hunrae? I will tear out her heart gladly, I assure you.~
@3814 = ~I do not think so. We have lost enough time already.~
@3815 = ~In the dungeon, Ricar found several love letters. What were they?~
@3816 = ~Thank you, <CHARNAME>. Please, if you find her, tell her that I... think of her.~
@3817 = ~Please... listen to her first. This is all I ask of you.~
@3818 = ~I understand. But you may visit these places, regardless.~
@3819 = ~<CHARNAME>, this is not for you to know. Do not pry, or you will regret it.~
@3820 = ~Here, the map of the Forest of Tethyr. And two more: Small Teeth Pass, and the North Forest.~
@3821 = ~The drow will not dare venture into the human lands without any disguise. A powerful enough priestess should have provided it for them, but she would likely not head into danger, herself.~
@3822 = ~They must have set a meeting point somewhere. Ricar pointed out the most likely spots to you. Now all that is left for you is to check these places. You are more than capable to do this, I am sure.~
@3823 = ~Even if they possessed the documents, they must have gotten rid of them already. What is the point?~
@3824 = ~Even so, we have to be sure. They must be punished.~
@3825 = ~Go. Ricar will await you, and I shall await the Rhynn Lanthorn. Hurry.~
@3826 = ~Yes? What have you accomplished?~
@3827 = ~Nothing, yet.~
@3828 = ~Perhaps they indeed were innocent, and fled to avoid repercussions...~
@3829 = ~Possibly. But tell me this, Ricar: do you want to see her again?~
@3830 = ~I do not know...~
@3831 = ~Tell me this, Xan: would you want <CHARNAME> to be hunted like an animal?~
@3832 = ~(sigh) You have always had a sharp eye. I have forgotten this. But you know my answer: no.~
@3833 = ~Neither do I... want her found. But duty matters more. Because if it did *not*, I would be searching for her, myself - to save her.~
@3834 = ~All love is foolish. You disgust me, both of you.~
@3835 = ~Viconia... what do you know? Or what do I know, for that matter?~
@3836 = ~A part of me wants to never see you again. Yet I hope that you will return with good news.~
@3837 = ~Hope is pointless, Ricar.~
@3838 = ~Nevertheless, I keep hoping.~
@3839 = ~Ah, <CHARNAME>. (sigh) Any news?~
@3840 = ~They are all dead, Ricar. I am sorry.~
@3841 = ~Hunrae indeed was guilty. I had to attack.~
@3842 = ~I let them go, Ricar. They were innocent.~
@3843 = ~(lie) I have found the drow, and killed them. They indeed were guilty.~
@3844 = ~(lie) I have found the drow, and let them go. They indeed were innocent.~
@3845 = ~Is she... was she truly guilty, then?~
@3846 = ~There can be no doubt about that, I'm afraid.~
@3847 = ~What about the documents?~
@3848 = ~We never found anything on their persons.~
@3849 = ~Nothing. They must have delivered the papers already.~
@3850 = ~I am sorry, Elhan. We failed.~
@3851 = ~We expected as much. Still, it is a hard blow.~
@3852 = ~Regardless, we must thank you. Irenicus dealt us a great blow, but now at least we are prepared, not lulled by a false hope.~
@3853 = ~Hurry, <CHARNAME>. While the Lanthorn is in the hands of Irenicus' allies, Suldanessellar's fate becomes blacker by the hour. We must stop this.~
@3854 = ~As for you, Ricar...~
@3855 = ~I... I am ready to take any punishment, my liege.~
@3856 = ~You will return to guarding the tunnels below. Do not fail me again.~
@3857 = ~Certain death...~
@3858 = ~Or redemption.~
@3859 = ~As you command. Xan, <CHARNAME>... thank you. I do not think we shall meet again.~
@3860 = ~Praise the Seldarine! She is alive...~
@3861 = ~I am far from certain this was the case, but I have no reason to doubt your words. So be it, then.~
@3862 = ~Ricar, your name is now cleared. Go; you are dismissed. As for you, <CHARNAME> - hurry. Without the Lanthorn, Suldanessellar's fate is sealed.~
@3863 = ~I see. Well... (sigh) Keep searching.~
@3864 = ~A lie.~
@3865 = ~<CHARNAME>, my sages have already proved themselves to you. Do not bother to continue.~
@3866 = ~Wait... who comes!~
@3867 = ~You! I met you in the lust chambers! You will die here today!~
@3868 = ~Never thought we'd meet again, did you? Well, today you will pay for what you nearly did to Xan!~
@3869 = ~Who are you, and what are you doing here?~
@3870 = ~Ricar sent us. He is worried for your safety.~
@3871 = ~We are searching for some very important documents. Tell us where they are!~
@3872 = ~Die, drow!~
@3873 = ~You? You were in Ust Natha in disguise?!~
@3874 = ~So, you know who I am. So be it.~
@3875 = ~The fool Ricar let us go, sealing the doom of his foolish kin! They stand alone, for the scrolls Irenicus left us are now in the hands of their allies. No one will aid them now! And you - you will die for thinking you could best the daughter of the First House! For Lolth!~
@3876 = ~Will you believe me?~
@3877 = ~We were hunted by all other drow, especially the Handmaidens, for we refused to follow Lolth' ways. Eventually Eilistraee, the Fair Maiden, beckoned us, and we headed for the surface, guided by Her hand.~
@3878 = ~A kind surface elf, Ricar, believed us, and let us go. We were thankful, but we decided not to come back, to avoid the wrath his kin would direct at us.~
@3879 = ~Now we are here, hunted and alone. My men wandered off to get some food to last us through the day. Please, do not hurt us. Not all drow are evil... just as not all surface elves are good.~
@3880 = ~Feh! Weaklings. Come, <CHARNAME>. Let us kill them and be done.~
@3881 = ~It may be so. But to let her go - like this? I do not know.~
@3882 = ~Do not believe them, <CHARNAME>! Th-they are drow... all drow are evil!~
@3883 = ~Please... spare us.~
@3884 = ~What about Irenicus and his documents? What do you know of these?~
@3885 = ~I think you are lying. If you are a good drow, how come you let Ricar down?~
@3886 = ~I do not believe you. You will die.~
@3887 = ~Eilistraee is called the Dark Maiden among her followers. You are lying.~
@3888 = ~We will. You are free to go.~
@3889 = ~Ricar! Oh, how is he?~
@3890 = ~I was heartsick over his fate, but I could not let him know where I was - his kin would hunt and kill me, you see. Please, thank him for me, and tell him... tell him I will remember him fondly. Will you?~
@3891 = ~Of course. You may leave now, dear woman.~
@3892 = ~I do not think so. I will kill you just to be sure!~
@3893 = ~What... what documents? My dear <PRO_MANWOMAN>, I know nothing of these... we are but exiles, and our strength is fading. I am sorry... please, leave me be. I must wait for my men and guide them to safety, before we are ambushed and killed.~
@3894 = ~I believe you. You may go.~
@3895 = ~Curse Lolth in front of me, and I shall let you go.~
@3896 = ~Perhaps you still have them! Die, drow!~
@3897 = ~Fool!~
@3898 = ~Oh, your mercy is boundless! Praise - ah, praise Eilistraee!~
@3899 = ~You! Behold the wrath of the Matron Mother, "Veldrin". You killed Hunrae of the First House, and for that you will pay!~
@3900 = ~Irenicus' archives.

Ricar, an elven mage from Elhan's camp, asked for my assistance in some matter that concerns Irenicus. I can approach him at any time to learn more.~
@3901 = ~Irenicus' archives.

Ricar wishes to visit Irenicus' lair under the Promenade again, to seek the documents Irenicus had stolen from the archive of the Queen of Suldanessellar. He refused to explain how Irenicus managed this, however.~
@3902 = ~Irenicus' archives.

We visited the dungeon, but found nothing, except some private correspondence. Ricar insisted those letters were not important, though Xan thought otherwise. Upon our escape, we were attacked by a vicious golem, and Ricar fled, likely to report to Elhan, since his spells could not harm the creature. I will need to talk to him again to plan our further actions.~ 
@3903 = ~Irenicus' archives.

It seems that a drow group might be in possession of Irenicus' documents. Elhan advised us to search the North Forest, Small Teeth Pass and the Forest of Tethyr. Ricar begged us not to kill the drow outright, seemingly believing that they are Eilistraee's followers. The decision rests with me.~
@3904 = ~Irenicus' archives.

I decided that Hunrae was harmless, and let her go.~
@3905 = ~Irenicus' archives.

Hunrae eventually admitted that they had had the documents, and delivered them already. I had to kill her and her allies.~
@3906 = ~Irenicus' archives.

Elhan was disappointed by my decision to let Hunrae go, but Ricar was relieved. It seems that we will never learn the true story.~
@3907 = ~Irenicus' archives.

Elhan was sorely disappointed by the loss of the documents, but satisfied with Hunrae's death. Ricar was distraught, however. In any case, now the elves know better than to expect help from their human allies.~
@3908 = ~Irenicus' archives.

Upon my arrival to Athkatla, I was attacked by a drow mage. His last words were of revenge for Hunrae of the First House. Now, I hope, this story is truly over.~
@3909 = ~You recognized the clone back in the dungeon, didn't you? Who was she?~
@3910 = ~A surface elf Ricar fell in love with a drow. A sad story.~
@3911 = ~(sigh) I thought you'd ask. Tell me, can you recall her face?~
@3912 = ~Yes, I can. High cheekbones, slanted eyes... all of it.~
@3913 = ~I would recognize her if I saw her again, yes.~
@3914 = ~Not really.~
@3915 = ~Regardless, I am sure you will recognize her, yes?~
@3916 = ~Now close your eyes, and try to recall the day of our meeting. Nashkel mines... red earth and stone... Do you remember?~
@3917 = ~I do.~
@3918 = ~Yes. Now what?~
@3919 = ~Er, Xan, are you sure you were there?~
@3920 = ~Unfortunately, I do not. Irenicus...~
@3921 = ~I traveled through the area, and so I saw what you should have seen.~
@3922 = ~(sigh) There is no need to continue. If only we get to this sadist in time... but enough of this. I was speaking of her, not of him.~
@3923 = ~Not far from the mines, a sculptor was working. Prism, his name was. He visited Evereska more than once; I saw his works and recognized his talent. However, the works I saw in Evereska were but pale reflections of that one.~
@3924 = ~Ellesime! He stole the emeralds, to show the sparkle in her eyes! I remember!~
@3925 = ~And then Greywolf killed him.~
@3926 = ~That one? Which one?~
@3927 = ~Ah, you remember. Precisely. Prism was trying to portray Ellesime, Queen of Suldanesllar.~
@3928 = ~Ellesime, Queen of Suldanessellar. Sculpted in stone.~
@3929 = ~I saw the Queen more than once, of course, and I recognized her. I do not want to know what her copies were doing in the dungeon, or what Irenicus had done to their bodies and minds. The very thought revolts me.~
@3930 = ~Please, let us not speak of it again. The atrocities he performed were many, and we shall find and kill him regardless. But just thinking that he... he...~
@3931 = ~Enough. And, <CHARNAME>... I never had a chance to tell you how brave you were. Surviving that dungeon must have been hard indeed. I salute you.~
@3932 = ~Thank you.~
@3933 = ~I still wonder about the exact nature of their relationship.~
@3934 = ~Ellesime cast a curse on him, his journal in Spellhold said so. Perhaps that was his revenge?~
@3935 = ~Ellesime cast a curse on him, and to get rid of it, he sought my spirit! I hate her!~
@3936 = ~I cannot say, <CHARNAME>. Perhaps when we meet him again, you will have your answer.~
@3937 = ~<CHARNAME>... (sigh) We are here, by your side, and we will not allow you to die. We will get to Irenicus, and tear your spirit out of his grasp. But we will not be able to punish the Queen of Suldanessellar. It is hopeless.~
@3938 = ~Although, Corellon knows, I would like to.~
@3939 = ~We have hope, melamin. Remember this.~
@3940 = ~(sigh) If only there was hope...~
@3941 = ~So... shall we?~
@3942 = ~He will not grieve for long. He will either die very soon, or find revenge in killing her dark brethren. In any case, the Ricar I know is lost.~
@3943 = ~You know him from the Academy, right?~
@3944 = ~Aw, Xan, it is not so hopeless! After all, some romance even the Children of Bhaal!~
@3945 = ~Could their story have a happy ending, do you think?~
@3946 = ~Not necessarily. Revenge is not for everyone.~
@3947 = ~Perhaps. But it is unlikely. That woman, Hunrae, played him for a fool in a most dishonorable way, and endangered his kin, at that. It scarred him, and badly.~
@3948 = ~I do not "know" anyone from there, no. I would recognize their faces and speak to them in a friendly way, should I meet them, but I know very little about them. In fact, I am much closer to you, or my former companions.~
@3949 = ~Always a loner, eh?~
@3950 = ~He seemed to know you well, though.~
@3951 = ~Good to hear it! Hmm, I must be a really special person, then.~
@3952 = ~How come you are so... cheerful about it? Not to imply anything, but I am convinced it is most often a tragedy, is it not?~
@3953 = ~Ricar could have been right about Hunrae. After all, some drow are indeed followers of Eilistraee, and bear no ill will to their surface comrades. Alas, she was no exception to the rule.~
@3954 = ~Do you think that a liaison between a drow and a surface elf is possible?~
@3955 = ~Well, what is the point? They were doomed, anyway.~
@3956 = ~How could he fall in love with her? Elves are taught to hate all drow, aren't they?~
@3957 = ~I wish it could have been different.~
@3958 = ~(sigh) It is as I have told you before. Magic consumed me, and left me no chance for acquiring any other pastimes.~
@3959 = ~Perhaps he did. I had little interest in others then, as I think I have told you before. Magic consumed me, and left me no chance of acquiring any other pastimes.~
@3960 = ~(sigh) Without a doubt.~
@3961 = ~Well, they say that love knows no bounds. It never ends well, however.~
@3962 = ~(shudder) <CHARNAME>, stop it, or I'd think I was talking to myself.~
@3963 = ~Then the world would have to be different.~
@3964 = ~(sigh) Come. We have done all we could.~
@3967 = ~No. You will not shrug my question off this easily. Not this time.~
@3968 = ~Look at <CHARNAME>. Look very closely. Do you know what had been done to <PRO_HIMHER> and <PRO_HISHER> sister, because of your - negligence? They lost their souls, their spirits, their very beings! By a stroke of pure luck, Bodhi has fallen, but <CHARNAME> is doomed if <PRO_HESHE> does not regain it in time!~
@3969 = ~You have no right to talk to me in this tone! Have you been there? Have you seen what the Exiles had done?~
@3970 = ~I am speaking to you thus *precisely* because of what the Exiles had done. You let them go - have you thought of the cities that nearly shared Suldanessellar's fate? Of men, women and children who died in agony? Of... of <CHARNAME>?~
@3971 = ~But of course not. After all, <PRO_HESHE> is a spawn of Bhaal, isn't <PRO_HESHE>? You'd only have been happier, if <PRO_HESHE> shared the fate of <PRO_HISHER> many brethren. And what's worse, two years ago I'd have thought the same. What a fool I had been...~
@3972 = ~I shall ponder on your words, and so, I am sure, will the Queen. But it will be of no importance if the Exile succeeds with his task! Please, heed my words.~
@3973 = ~(sigh) It's no use. I might as well have been talking to the wall.~
@3974 = ~What? What gives you the - no matter. Either you desist, or you will find yourself lacking much more than a Herald position.~
@3975 = ~Such fervor! But she will remain alive. After she is - restrained - no one will as much as lay a finger on her.~
@3976 = ~(sigh) Here it comes, our inevitable doom. <CHARNAME>, tell me true: did you really hope to join Imoen and Irenicus this way?~
@3977 = ~As an enchanter, did you ever want to enchant someone... special for you?~
@3978 = ~(sigh) What answer would you want to hear, I wonder?~
@3979 = ~If you mean - whether I *did* use my powers in such a nefarious way, the answer is, of course, no. I wondered idly once or twice, especially at a very young age, when my mentor sometimes wouldn't understand my arguments, no matter how I tried - ~
@3980 = ~But you did not mean it like this, of course. (sigh) You see, <CHARNAME>, I was not alone at the Academy. Young sorcerers, wizards, diviners, enchanters - these were abound within its walls. And while the concept of honor was not alien to many, to some... it was.~
@3981 = ~Do you mean that someone used his powers in such a way, and you learnt of it?~
@3982 = ~Are you going to tell me a story from your Academy times? Please do!~
@3983 = ~Yes, but what about you? I want to know of you, not of the others.~
@3984 = ~More than one young elf secretly tried his - or her - enchantments on the object of their choosing. Of course, mostly they failed, and those who were more, ah, talented were punished accordingly, but once, just once in my time, an attempt was successful.~
@3985 = ~It was a disaster. You see, we live long, and over the course of our lives we may become attracted again and again, but we love but once, very rarely twice.~
@3986 = ~What do you mean?~
@3987 = ~When we bond?~
@3988 = ~I know that much, yes.~
@3989 = ~The elven bond signifies love. It lasts a lifetime, and can only be built freely. It cannot be enforced - by anyone. Even by someone madly in love.~
@3990 = ~Does it mean that you are simply attracted to me, and do not love me?~
@3991 = ~I know. After all, we share a bond.~
@3992 = ~What does it have to do with the story at hand?~
@3993 = ~So, they could not bond?~
@3994 = ~<CHARNAME>... (sigh) For how long have we been together? Hours? Days?~
@3995 = ~Don't you see?~
@3996 = ~Precisely.~
@3997 = ~They failed to build a bond. The full, open willingness, this desire to share unconditionally - it was not there. Not from one side, at least.~
@3998 = ~Having realized what he had done... (sigh) The young elf dispelled the enchantment and took his own life.~
@3999 = ~Oh.~
@4000 = ~Was a broken heart worth it?~
@4001 = ~What about you, though? Did you have any... experience?~
@4002 = ~I was aware of my powers since the day I started developing them. I was aware that I could... get my desire, so to say. And this was precisely what held me back. Selfish as it may seem, I want to be loved as a man, not as a mage.~
@4003 = ~I love you.~
@4004 = ~I understand.~
@4005 = ~Thank you... for opening up to me.~
@4006 = ~To him, apparently, it was. I do not know... but I also do not know whether I'd be able to go on, if you died.~
@4007 = ~I know.~
@4008 = ~(Xan shakes his head.)~
@4009 = ~You may regret these words, yet.~
@4010 = ~You are opening to me a world I used to know nothing about... despite all my magic. Thank you, <CHARNAME>.~
@4011 = ~It is not hopeless, Xan. Look at me and Viconia.~
@4012 = ~I think I am growing tired of adventuring...~
@4013 = ~I wish we became lovers in Baldur's Gate. Perhaps things would be different then.~
@4014 = ~It is hard, isn't it?~
@4015 = ~I guess. Fighting all the time, especially.~
@4016 = ~What I want is to have a home of my own.~
@4017 = ~I am just tired. I want a long rest.~
@4018 = ~And for you, too?~
@4019 = ~Quite. Again, and again...~
@4020 = ~The good thing is they die. Not me.~
@4021 = ~(sigh) And again.~
@4022 = ~Perhaps once I am powerful enough, it will not bother me as much.~
@4023 = ~It will change sooner or later, I assure you. But you already know.~
@4024 = ~(sigh) And then death comes.~
@4025 = ~(sigh) There is never enough power, and I should know. Besides, your enemies conveniently become more powerful, as well - as if they were picking tips from somewhere. No, it is futile.~
@4026 = ~A beautiful dream, I know. Though some of my fellow Greycloaks are disappointed rather than happy, when it comes to be.~
@4027 = ~How so?~
@4028 = ~Let them. It will be different for me.~
@4029 = ~Definitely a point to keep in mind.~
@4030 = ~Difficult to say, but when I visited one of them, I had a distinct impression he had a house, not a home. He was not happy there... perhaps because nearly all his comrades had died. I might well share his fate.~
@4031 = ~Perhaps. Who can say? Not me, in any case.~
@4032 = ~I wouldn't bother. It is not as you are going to be allowed to settle down anytime soon.~
@4033 = ~(sigh) You will not get it. Or, rather, you will - in the grave.~
@4034 = ~Maybe if I hide really well...~
@4035 = ~Perhaps after I deal with Irenicus... ?~
@4036 = ~Yes, you are right. It is hopeless.~
@4037 = ~Uh-huh. Have you forgotten about divination magic? I think you have.~
@4038 = ~How can you be so sure that no one else will come? Have you forgotten the likes of Sarevok? There must be quite a few walking the Realms by now - grown up, and ready to kill. You.~
@4039 = ~Miracles happen. But not with us.~
@4040 = ~I am tired, yes, but not more than I normally am. I have been 'adventuring', or, rather, doing my duty for longer than you have been alive, you know this.~
@4041 = ~Do you ever get at least a few months of rest? Or is it always like this?~
@4042 = ~I am sorry to hear it.~
@4043 = ~What do we do, Xan?~
@4044 = ~Almost. I get some rest between my missions, but it is nothing more than a mockery of rest. Very few in Evereska actually understand what we Greycloaks stand against.~
@4045 = ~Do not waste your emotions on me: it will help little. Though, I admit, sometimes it does.~
@4046 = ~Lie down and die? I do not see any alternative, I'm afraid.~
@4047 = ~In any case, we are entitled to *a rest*, if not *The Rest*. We could use it now, if you wish to.~
@4048 = ~Good idea.~
@4049 = ~Er... here?!~
@4050 = ~Not yet, I fear.~
@4051 = ~Hmm, good point. Soon.~
@4052 = ~(yawn) Excellent.~
@4053 = ~Whatever you say. (sigh) As long as we do not get ambushed in our beds.~
@4054 = ~Er... I guess not. Later, then. (sigh) As long as we do not get ambushed in our beds.~
@4055 = ~Dearest... I know. Would that I could hide you somewhere quiet, peaceful... safe.~
@4056 = ~Why don't you?~
@4057 = ~Like Evereska?~
@4058 = ~Let's try it!~
@4059 = ~I dream of it, sometimes. But it wouldn't solve anything.~
@4060 = ~It is impossible, melamin. Ruffians and bandits may leave you alone in a forest cabin, but someone of Irenicus' caliber will not.~
@4061 = ~Nowhere is safe, and Evereska is no exception. Besides, the real danger for you lies within the city, for your taint will be recognized, and then not even my influence will be enough to allow you to stay.~
@4062 = ~No, it wouldn't. But I am glad if these dreams bring you release. (sigh) Mine are wicked, wretched things.~
@4063 = ~I wonder, would you choose such a fate for yourself, if you had a choice? If Gorion and Harpers were there to protect you, or if your heritage was different?~
@4064 = ~Perhaps. At least for a while.~
@4065 = ~I would like to see the world, to travel, but adventuring as such does not seem attractive.~
@4066 = ~Not at this point. Maybe later in life.~
@4067 = ~Under no circumstances. No.~
@4068 = ~It is good to know that you can change your destiny at any given time, is it not? It is hard when it is so... inevitable.~
@4069 = ~And I would show you the world gladly. I have seen much of it, in fact, and there are places I know you'd like. You have seen so little of it, have you not?~
@4070 = ~Adventuring is the privilege of the young, they say. I'd say it is a curse, but who will listen?~
@4071 = ~I more than understand.~
@4072 = ~I often think how it might feel, to come home. Even if it is somewhere outside of the elven lands; even if it is not exactly a palace.~
@4073 = ~But then again, my home is with you.~
@4074 = ~And mine - with you.~
@4075 = ~But it is not a real home, is it?~
@4076 = ~Thank you, Xan.~
@4077 = ~But what of your home in Evereska?~
@4078 = ~Our perfect home...~
@4079 = ~It depends on how you view it, <CHARNAME>. Or so I think.~
@4080 = ~In any case, tonight we'll have none of this adventuring nonsense, this I promise you.~
@4081 = ~(sigh) You must be laughing at me, my fair lady. <CHARNAME>... how many times have I told you that I cannot return with you, and I do not want to return without you? It is not that hard to remember, is it?~
@4082 = ~Though they say that love clouds the mind. In which case, I can only thank the heavens and wish for your absent-mindness to last.~
@4083 = ~Mmm. What do you expect me to say, I wonder?~
@4084 = ~That there is some way to make it right.~
@4085 = ~Do you love me?~
@4086 = ~My mistake. I shouldn't have started this.~
@4087 = ~What would have happened?~
@4088 = ~No, <CHARNAME>, there is not.~
@4089 = ~(sigh) But you know the answer.~
@4090 = ~Yes, you shouldn't have... but I may as well answer anyway.~
@4091 = ~You see, the Slayer is not something you could "make right", or pretend it does not exist. I do not know what kind of... of love could have kept us together, except an elven bond - and a bond would be folly in your case, for my inevitable demise could then become yours.~
@4092 = ~This is right, <CHARNAME>. This - alliance, or whatever have you - that we have now is right. Do not regret anything, for there is no point.~
@4093 = ~Alliance? You are going to leave after I regain my soul!~
@4094 = ~No. We, together - that was right! Now it isn't.~
@4095 = ~I know. But what if... ?~
@4096 = ~Would you prefer not to regain your soul and have me by your side eternally? I thought you were more reasonable than this.~
@4097 = ~You will regain your soul, <CHARNAME>. Your bright, daring spirit. And I will be gone.~
@4098 = ~Soon, you will open your eyes and notice a large queue of men and elves both, who would not care how your heritage mingles with their station. Who will help you conquer the Slayer, tame him or welcome him. Who will love you much better than I.~
@4099 = ~And I will be gone.~
@4100 = ~Don't. My heart is breaking as it is.~
@4101 = ~What are you thinking of?~
@4102 = ~Xan, what if I said I loved another?~
@4103 = ~Are you in love, Xan?~
@4104 = ~Death.~
@4105 = ~(groan)~
@4106 = ~Ye gods... why me? Why do I have to listen to this?~
@4107 = ~I should have known.~
@4108 = ~Do continue.~
@4109 = ~(sigh) What is the point?~
@4110 = ~Well, you did ask.~
@4111 = ~What? It is not as I've anything to add, is it?~
@4112 = ~Well, you could say how inevitable it is...~
@4113 = ~Nothing? How about "Life is so hollow", or - ~
@4114 = ~I guess not. I was trying to strike a conversation, though.~
@4115 = ~True. I can only agree, in my predicament...~
@4116 = ~As you wish. Let's continue on, then.~
@4117 = ~What is the point?~
@4118 = ~Exactly!~
@4119 = ~You look almost hopeful sometimes. Why the gloominess?~
@4120 = ~We are friends. Talking usually helps, you know.~
@4121 = ~<CHARNAME>, how many times have I told you that you are insufferable? Though sometimes I am almost glad of it...~
@4122 = ~Never mind. I appreciate your concern, but I'd like to be on my own for now.~
@4123 = ~All right. Let me know if you feel better.~
@4124 = ~Let us continue in silence, then.~
@4125 = ~Right. So *that* is what friends are for: so you could ask them to leave you alone.~
@4126 = ~Certainly. And - thank you. Our conversations tend to end with me thanking you all too often, have you noticed?~
@4127 = ~It means more than you think.~
@4128 = ~Thank you. Our conversations tend to end with me thanking you all too often, have you noticed?~
@4129 = ~... which only gets worse and worse. I am sorry, my friend.~
@4130 = ~No.~
@4131 = ~I will probably curse myself for asking, but I do wonder whether you wanted to discuss our past and present female companions, or pester me for something else.~
@4132 = ~(grin) Yes, you will indeed regret it.~
@4133 = ~Indeed, you are reading my thoughts!~
@4134 = ~I think I will leave you alone... this time.~
@4135 = ~(sigh) I am just so very grateful.~
@4136 = ~(groan) I am doomed.~
@4137 = ~And?~
@4138 = ~Hmm... No. I think not.~
@4139 = ~It's just sometimes I realize that *everyone* falls in love. Even you. And I wonder.~
@4140 = ~Hey, come on! Don't I get to pester my companions a little?~
@4141 = ~Look, we are friends. Mates. Close companions. Why not share a tale or two?~
@4142 = ~Then you will have to keep wondering, I fear.~
@4143 = ~A little means a *little*, not a full-blown stream of questions and requests. Don't you agree?~
@4144 = ~Because.~
@4145 = ~And, since we *are* friends, a friendly warning. You do not want to see me angry, do you? Especially now.~
@4146 = ~We will talk later, but, please, choose another topic.~
@4147 = ~You.~
@4148 = ~No, really?~
@4149 = ~Me? What is it about me?~
@4150 = ~This I know, but what exactly?~
@4151 = ~This was all I needed to know.~
@4152 = ~Hmm? No more interrogation? Something must be wrong with you to<DAYNIGHT>.~
@4153 = ~Mmmm... <CHARNAME>, I'd rather not reveal it... in detail.~
@4154 = ~Ooooh! No, you will! I demand it of you!~
@4155 = ~Is it something... intimate?~
@4156 = ~All right. But what about the general picture?~
@4157 = ~Aw, you are such a bore! Away with you, then.~
@4158 = ~(sigh) Must I?~
@4159 = ~What do you think? Of course!~
@4160 = ~If you think you can get rid of me *this* easily, think again.~
@4161 = ~Well, you could lie, of course...~
@4162 = ~No, no. Never mind.~
@4163 = ~To you? No. (sigh) Never.~
@4164 = ~Not that I really mind, it is just... strange? But very well.~
@4165 = ~I was thinking of how you may look in the future. Whether your hair grows longer, or becomes shorter, whether your features become softer or more pronounced... and I could not imagine it. It was as if in a blur... shrouded in darkness. Eerie, isn't it?~
@4166 = ~Quite. But you will see for yourself, I am sure.~
@4167 = ~I thought the elves were only concerned with the inner beauty.~
@4168 = ~Perhaps this is because I will die?~
@4169 = ~Xan, if I ever die as an elf, how will I look in Arvandor?~
@4170 = ~Is it even possible? Can you, yourself, imagine that in five, fifteen, fifty years we shall be sitting somewhere together? I cannot.~
@4171 = ~We are, but this is no reason to ignore the rest. Though the inner beauty is indeed important, but for a different reason.~
@4172 = ~Don't you - don't you dare say this!~
@4173 = ~Never again. Please, a'maelamin... it is bad as it is.~
@4174 = ~You... you are not destined for Arvandor, you know this. But hypothetically...~
@4175 = ~When we die, our bodies are not preserved in our afterlife, as you know. Instead, we become ourselves in appearance, but according to our inner selves.~
@4176 = ~One can be seven hundred years old and still feel young - and in Arvandor, they will look young. If they feel genuinely mature and wizened with years, they will look thus. If... if you were able to reach Arvandor, you would be able to stay eternally young... and improbably beautiful.~
@4177 = ~Ah, how beautiful...~
@4178 = ~How do you know? I may well find that my inner self is a crone.~
@4179 = ~Or maybe *too* young. Will you dare to kiss an innocent babe?~
@4180 = ~I will become an improbably perfect pile of dust, trust me on this.~
@4181 = ~Nice, but being a goddess suits me more, I think.~
@4182 = ~... and how improbable.~
@4183 = ~(sigh) Now you know my thoughts better than I.~
@4184 = ~We are bonded, <CHARNAME>. I have seen the real you.~
@4185 = ~I trust you in everything, but on this matter, I prefer not to.~
@4186 = ~To be honest, I think it would horribly clash with your hair.~
@4187 = ~(sigh) Seldarine, I started joking about your heritage... I am truly doomed.~
@4188 = ~You are free to do whatever you wish. Whatever your designs are.~
@4189 = ~And our bond?~
@4190 = ~I know, but what would you do?~
@4191 = ~And you would not mind?~
@4192 = ~I see.~
@4193 = ~It lingers. Breaking it is not unheard of, but it is rare - and potentially dangerous.~
@4194 = ~The choice will always belong to you. I have long made mine - irrevocably, I'm afraid.~
@4195 = ~And you wouldn't mind if I start to romance someone else?~
@4196 = ~Wow! So many new opportunities!~
@4197 = ~I will not abuse your trust.~
@4198 = ~I do not think it will ever come to this.~
@4199 = ~You are aware that you are playing with fire, are you not? What do you intend, <CHARNAME>?~
@4200 = ~First, answer: will you tolerate seeing me with other men or not?~
@4201 = ~To see how you will react, of course!~
@4202 = ~Well... wait some time and see. Heheheh.~
@4203 = ~I was just curious, really. I am sorry.~
@4204 = ~(sigh) And yet you do not sound sorry for your inquiry at all.~
@4205 = ~I do not think so. There are some boundaries I will not cross.~
@4206 = ~I am bound to stay with you by love and lore, but I will not tolerate seeing such cruelty in you, be it a result of your taint or otherwise. Remember this.~
@4207 = ~<CHARNAME>, don't you even realize how hurtful it may be to... to get asked such a question? Or is it your heritage showing itself?~
@4208 = ~Futility.~
@4209 = ~Thought so.~
@4210 = ~Anything else?~
@4211 = ~Too bad.~
@4212 = ~The futility of our relationship or the futility of something else?~
@4213 = ~The futility of it all, including the futility of this very discussion. Do I make myself clear?~
@4214 = ~Xan, do not snap at me.~
@4215 = ~Fine! Go and mope about, for all I care!~
@4216 = ~Talking is not futile. It helps.~
@4217 = ~I apologize. But there is no point, don't you see this?~
@4218 = ~You care, or you would not have asked. But it is futile.~
@4219 = ~Not in this case.~
@4220 = ~Do you?~
@4221 = ~Love someone else? No. At least, not yet.~
@4222 = ~I do not know.~
@4223 = ~Yes, I do.~
@4224 = ~That's not the point. What if I did?~
@4225 = ~I wish you happiness.~
@4226 = ~<CHARNAME>... you know how I feel for you. But you also know that I fear for you, and... sometimes... fear you, as well. If your heart sways, follow it, for there is little for you here.~
@4227 = ~Do you mean that you do not care if I choose someone else?~
@4228 = ~Very inspiring, thank you.~
@4229 = ~Never. I will never abandon you.~
@4230 = ~I think I shall do so.~
@4231 = ~You misunderstand me. I... care for you, deeply. Don't you know this? But you must know something else.~
@4232 = ~Despite anything the future may bring? Do not say things so rashly. You may indeed regret them.~
@4233 = ~Do.~
@4234 = ~The choice belongs only to you. However strongly I feel about you, I will never stand in the way of your heart.~
@4235 = ~But you won't be fighting for it, will you?~
@4236 = ~So you are going to wait passively? Is this love?~
@4237 = ~You trust me more than I trust myself.~
@4238 = ~A noble position.~
@4239 = ~I see. I will think on it.~
@4240 = ~You are not a prize to fight for. You are a woman to love.~
@4241 = ~Only this is - love.~
@4242 = ~I cannot imagine it being any other way, <CHARNAME>.~
@4243 = ~You are welcome to. And - should your heart be indeed swayed - tell me. Please.~
@4244 = ~Xan, I've got nothing to do, so why don't we talk about - something?~
@4245 = ~Well, thank you!~
@4246 = ~I am sorry, I... do not feel well now. I am wounded, and... yes. Perhaps some... some other time.~
@4247 = ~For how long?~
@4248 = ~I beg your pardon?~
@4249 = ~What?~
@4250 = ~For however long it is necessary. Why?~
@4251 = ~For how long are you going to pester me with absolutely pointless, meaningless and most of all, annoying questions?~
@4252 = ~Now wait here just a minute!~
@4253 = ~Pester?!~
@4254 = ~Annoying questions, hmm? You seemed to like it well enough before.~
@4255 = ~Hmph! Here is your precious silence, then.~
@4256 = ~Very well, I shall leave you alone.~
@4257 = ~You heard me well enough. I cannot stand it, <CHARNAME>! Not that you are exactly a bad leader, but have you ever thought that I might have other things on my mind? Such as the insignificant matter of my wounds, for example? Do you ever think of anyone besides yourself?~
@4258 = ~Yes, I do. Otherwise you'd have long been dead of these very wounds.~
@4259 = ~I thought you liked me.~
@4260 = ~I thought you loved me.~
@4261 = ~I thought we were friends.~
@4262 = ~No, I do not. I am a heartless bastard, and it is a wonder how you've been putting up with me for so long.~
@4263 = ~What do you think?~
@4264 = ~All right, all right. I will leave you alone.~
@4265 = ~I do not think you are a bad person, no. It is just - ~
@4266 = ~I do - ~
@4267 = ~We are - ~
@4268 = ~This is not the point! <CHARNAME>, don't you understand that you are not a supernatural being whom anyone would give their right hands to listen to at any given time?~
@4269 = ~Xan, what's wrong with you?~
@4270 = ~Oh, just shut up!~
@4271 = ~I will not approach you again. It is obvious you do not want my company.~
@4272 = ~I apologize. I will leave you to your... mood.~
@4273 = ~Nothing! The blood dripping off my robes must be my hallucination, I am sure!~
@4274 = ~Gladly!~
@4275 = ~No... <CHARNAME>, I... (sigh)~
@4276 = ~Do you remember how I told you I was in love before? It seems that it was unrequited love.~
@4277 = ~I look at you and think of the nights we spent together...~
@4278 = ~Will you miss me? Our moments together, holding hands, our conversations?~
@4279 = ~Oh. I am sorry, <CHARNAME>. But being doomed does have its advantages, does it not? At least, you are going to forget about it very soon.~
@4280 = ~I'd prefer to live and remember, if it is the same to you.~
@4281 = ~Small consolation, but yes, you are right.~
@4282 = ~I will be fine, really. It is hard now, though.~
@4283 = ~I'd offer to help you, but meddling with your memory and emotions is extremely dangerous - you *are* a Bhaalspawn, after all. Still, there are certain... remedies. Do you wish me to tell you?~
@4284 = ~You mean, like finding someone else?~
@4285 = ~I could replace them with you, I suppose. Why not?~
@4286 = ~Of course. Do tell.~
@4287 = ~I think I will be fine on my own.~
@4288 = ~No, no, right now it will only make it worse. Perhaps with time... if you have time.~
@4289 = ~I'd prefer *not* to be dragged into this, if you do not mind.~
@4290 = ~Time is on your side, but it heals too slowly. Way too slowly...~
@4291 = ~Ah - excuse me. I seem to have drifted away for a moment. Something - something else may help you, however.~
@4292 = ~Take one breath - very slowly, and count to five under your breath. When you are done, count to five again. Do it again as the air leaves your lungs, and take another pause of five before taking the next breath.~
@4293 = ~I assure you, within an hour all thoughts of your... unfortunate experience will be gone. It is a tried and tested method, if used often enough.~
@4294 = ~You will do fine in any case, I am sure. After all, you have been through much worse.~
@4295 = ~I have indeed.~
@4296 = ~Not really, but still, I will manage.~
@4297 = ~Did you have similar experiences in the past?~
@4298 = ~Did you have to resort to different methods to cure your own pain?~
@4299 = ~Come. Let us see how we manage against Irenicus. A broken heart is nothing compared to meeting him, I fear.~
@4300 = ~If I had, do you think I would tell you, or anyone? And if I had not, your questioning is useless.~
@4301 = ~And here I thought that I had forgotten how to blush many, many years ago...~
@4302 = ~It becomes you, too.~
@4303 = ~(snort) (giggle)~
@4304 = ~Squee! I made Xan blush!~
@4305 = ~Now I am blushing, too...~
@4306 = ~And what precisely did happen "many, many" years ago?~
@4307 = ~Indeed? Who would have thought.~
@4308 = ~(sigh) Oh, <CHARNAME>...~
@4309 = ~Yes, you insufferably adorable little elf. You did.~
@4310 = ~Mmm... What a sight.~
@4311 = ~(sigh) <CHARNAME>! As if you thought I'd really tell you.~
@4312 = ~When I think of the times we'd shared, I remember your voice best. Your beautiful, beautiful voice. It becomes so much lower... and then changes its tone entirely. And then...~
@4313 = ~Ahem. I am sorry, <CHARNAME>. I probably should not continue - ~
@4314 = ~Ah... yes. You'd better not. At least, not now.~
@4315 = ~Why?~
@4316 = ~Do! I'd like you to.~
@4317 = ~ - for if I do, I am not sure I will be able to control myself. Your presence does make me lose my head, despite any and all mental protections my profession provides. It is hopeless.~
@4318 = ~Well, if it is hopeless... why don't you surrender?~
@4319 = ~Now I am sorely tempted to...~
@4320 = ~Come, then. Let us wait until tonight, shall we?~
@4321 = ~Only after dark...~
@4322 = ~And... oh, dear, how lucky I am...~
@4323 = ~You have an amazing talent to make things harder for me, do you know this?~
@4324 = ~Yes, I will. What of it?~
@4325 = ~This only proves that you are going to do a wrong thing by leaving!~
@4326 = ~Oh, come on! I know you aren't going to leave me at all!~
@4327 = ~It means much for me to know this.~
@4328 = ~Nothing.~
@4329 = ~Let us go, then. I would gladly stop and have some light-hearted banter with you, but you very well know it is impossible.~
@4330 = ~<CHARNAME>, what else can I do? To stay and watch you devoured by this... this thing? Or to wait until it tears me in half?~
@4331 = ~Or to believe in me?~
@4332 = ~Or to hope that everything will be all right, because it will?~
@4333 = ~Or to stay and support me?~
@4334 = ~I understand your reasons. Go, if you must.~
@4335 = ~<CHARNAME>...~
@4336 = ~I could promise you to stay. It is not that difficult: since Irenicus will kill me in any case, what do I lose?~
@4337 = ~But what if he doesn't? I do not want to look like a liar in your eyes - for some reason, it still disturbs me.~
@4338 = ~I will help you to reclaim your soul, and to continue on your path. But the rest of your destiny is yours, your own. I am tired of telling you this, to be honest.~
@4339 = ~Come. I would gladly have some light-hearted banter with you and remember the old times... but you very well know it is impossible.~
@4340 = ~You put your duty above all, but soon the day will come when you will have to make your choices. Think well, wielder, for not all Spawn deserve the scorn they receive.~
@4341 = ~Thank you for the warning... I suppose.~
@4342 = ~Xan, about the Slayer...~
@4343 = ~It is so hard to be a drow in the Underdark... Can we talk about it?~
@4344 = ~(Xan jumps in horror.)~
@4345 = ~Oh, Corellon, not again!~
@4346 = ~I... I am sorry. What - what did you want to say?~
@4347 = ~I could not control it, but still, I am sorry that it attacked you.~
@4348 = ~Kill me, if I ever take this cursed shape again.~
@4349 = ~If I turn into the Slayer again, run.~
@4350 = ~I promise, I will never become the Slayer again.~
@4351 = ~I think I can control this thing now. So just fight alongside me, and do not be afraid.~
@4352 = ~(sigh) Yes, let's. How I wish things would have been different...~
@4353 = ~What can I say? I am sorry, too.~
@4354 = ~That's it. Let us go, now.~
@4355 = ~If I take this form one more time, kill me.~
@4356 = ~You should run away, if it happens again.~
@4357 = ~I promise, I will never become the Slayer again.~
@4358 = ~But I can control it now, so do not worry.~
@4359 = ~Even if I barely knew you, and we were bound only by a mutual goal, I would not. And as it is - how can you even ask that? Do you think that I, or anyone else, for that matter, would be able to do this and to live serenely afterwards? Or do you wish to die this badly?~
@4360 = ~Being a Slayer is worse than death. These transformations kill the real me.~
@4361 = ~Do you think I will be able to live with myself, if I kill you?~
@4362 = ~Then at least run away, so I would not hurt you.~
@4363 = ~I do not want to die, but what should I do?~
@4364 = ~Even if it would mean abandoning you? Are you even aware of what you are saying?~
@4365 = ~No, no. Just run and wait until I become myself again.~
@4366 = ~What? I turn into a horrible monster, and yet, you are not willing to abandon me entirely?~
@4367 = ~Yes. You should not risk your life so.~
@4368 = ~<CHARNAME>, you may say all you want, but when the taint grabs a hold of you, you will be able to do nothing. No, it is hopeless.~
@4369 = ~Then let us go, and forget this conversation.~
@4370 = ~Then kill the Slayer, if it grabs hold of me.~
@4371 = ~Then run away, if it happens again!~
@4372 = ~It is not. I just know there is hope.~
@4373 = ~There is none.~
@4374 = ~Then we must find a way to stop them! Seldarine, death is never the only solution. The last solution, yes, but the only one? Never.~ 
@4375 = ~(sigh) Now I spout nonsense. "Find a way to stop them", indeed...~
@4376 = ~I do not know. I do not see a way... I am so sorry, <CHARNAME>, but it is indeed hopeless.~
@4377 = ~But while there is a chance to reach Irenicus - don't you dare think of death.~
@4378 = ~The most reasonable solution, I suppose. Yes, I shall do so; after all, what choice do we have?~
@4379 = ~(sigh) Let us go. How I wish things were different...~
@4380 = ~No. Even doomed as you are, and soulless as you are. Or perhaps that's precisely the reason?~
@4381 = ~<CHARNAME>, I'll appreciate it if you let me decide for myself what I can and cannot do. And I cannot abandon you.~
@4382 = ~We are doomed, <CHARNAME>. What is there to talk about?~
@4383 = ~Yes, yes, it is pointless. But humor me this one time... please.~
@4384 = ~Precisely about this. Oh, how doomed we are, and how pointless it all is! Xan, join in!~
@4385 = ~(sigh) Yes, you are right. I shall leave you alone.~
@4386 = ~Very well. Though nothing is well any more... and, perhaps, never has been.~
@4387 = ~(snort) I do not think you need to talk about anything right now. You seem to be in excellent shape - that is, except for the reasoning part. But very well.~
@4388 = ~I... perhaps I spoke hastily.~
@4389 = ~I will listen to you. What is it?~
@4390 = ~My hair looks different; my hands; my eyes feel different, even.~
@4391 = ~I am not vicious by nature, Xan. Being a drow does not come naturally to me.~
@4392 = ~As you might have noticed, the Underdark is not the most hospitable place.~
@4393 = ~I keep thinking about Irenicus and my soul, and lingering here frustrates me.~
@4394 = ~I am worried about my companions, including you. It must be hard for everyone.~
@4395 = ~Nothing, really. Forget it.~
@4396 = ~The worst of curses. Even if you manage to forget where you are, your own body mercilessly reminds you of it. It is perfect for keeping us alert, but for keeping us sane? I do not know.~
@4397 = ~I could say the same about myself. But, vicious or no, both of us have killed many more than an average drow, be it a subservient male or a Handmaiden of Lolth.~
@4398 = ~(snort) Believe me, I have failed to notice that completely. Thank you for opening my eyes, I suppose.~
@4399 = ~We could exit to the west, and continue all the way to the surface. That would mean not honoring our promise to Adalon, but... (sigh)~
@4400 = ~The drow outpost will not let us through, but I might still have one of these cantrips which make one more... intimidating, so I suppose I could arrange passage for us, despite being an inferior male. The choice is yours.~
@4401 = ~It is - for me, at least. Your situation is the hardest, though.~
@4402 = ~Yes, well... stopping for an idle chat here can only hasten our demise, after all.~
@4403 = ~Probably continuing this talk is indeed pointless: I do not know about you, but I feel worse and worse with every minute. Let us just... concentrate on the task at hand and try not to die? (sigh) Though it sounds superfluously naive, I know.~
@4404 = ~And one last thing: do hold on.~
@4405 = ~After all, reckless as you are, we will not be able to survive without you. And some of us, I dare say, will even miss your presence.~
@4406 = ~And take care. Please. I'd add something remarkably tender, but by now you must know all these phrases by heart, don't you?~
@4407 = ~I do not know if it helps, but I am still willing to lay down my life for you. It is worth little, however: much as I resent it, I have only one.~
@4408 = ~Take care.~
@4409 = ~We've traveled together for a fair while already. What do you think of me - as a leader, as a companion, as a person?~
@4410 = ~Don't you die on me, Xan. Don't you dare to.~
@4411 = ~I am afraid to lose you.~
@4412 = ~I miss Gorion. I miss him dearly.~
@4413 = ~I miss lost friends, as well, my parents especially. Will you tell me about him?~
@4414 = ~I do not remember much. But he cared, and it meant a lot.~
@4415 = ~He saw past my heritage, and took me for who I was.~
@4416 = ~He was willing to sacrifice his own life for me, a Bhaalspawn. I guess that says it all.~
@4417 = ~He told me stories: of knights and beautiful ladies, of villains and rogues... but my own story remained unknown.~
@4418 = ~I've known you for a shorter time than he, but I think I understand why.~
@4419 = ~However...~
@4420 = ~That he withheld your true heritage from you troubles me. Why? You looked so helpless, when you discovered that letter...~
@4421 = ~I was. I wonder, too.~
@4422 = ~He wanted to shelter me, I suppose.~
@4423 = ~And he was right. Imagine if I grew up with this weight on my shoulders?~
@4424 = ~I was resentful when I found out he lied to me. But he is dead...~
@4425 = ~You weren't there. Who told you this? Imoen?~
@4426 = ~Helpless?!~
@4427 = ~Sheltering you seems the most probable reason. And perhaps he was right. But I still wonder: would allowing you to know allow him to live, or would it simply hasten his demise? What effect would it have had on you? But I am rambling again.~
@4428 = ~I visited Candlekeep on my way to Evereska, briefly... there were scrolls I copied, including the full account of Alaundo's prophecies. Or, at least, the part that concerned Bhaal's children. (sigh) And I collected some pieces of gossip, too.~
@4429 = ~I am sorry for not telling you this, but it seemed irrelevant during our meeting: I was too worried when I saw what Irenicus' tortures and imprisonment had done to you. But now you know.~
@4430 = ~He is dead, and you cannot ask him about keeping secrets from you... or, indeed, about anything else. It hurts, does it not? When you think of the little wrongs you have caused and never apologized for, and now there is no one to apologize to...~
@4431 = ~(sigh) Excuse me.~
@4432 = ~No, it is fine. I often think of those departed and wish I could apologize, or just tell them I loved them.~
@4433 = ~Yes, of course. It got to you, too, didn't it?~
@4434 = ~Yes, let us go.~
@4435 = ~It is hard. But perhaps it has to get worse before it gets better. So far, however, it does not.~
@4436 = ~Yes... let us go.~
@4437 = ~Oh, were you brilliant and sure of yourself, then? Somehow, I cannot recall this.~
@4438 = ~I admire your skills, certainly.~
@4439 = ~Cautious, aren't you?~
@4440 = ~And my personal qualities?~
@4441 = ~And this is all?~
@4442 = ~I see.~
@4443 = ~I do not think there is much else to tell. You are young, <CHARNAME>, you are still changing. And... there is your taint to consider, as well.~
@4444 = ~My taint. Certainly. I am dark and dangerous.~
@4445 = ~Young? I am of age, and I've more experience than many.~
@4446 = ~My personality has already formed. Tell me.~
@4447 = ~And you are my friend, despite all this.~
@4448 = ~And yet, you are young.~
@4449 = ~(sigh) I do not know, my friend. You are an enigma to me still, do you know that? Sometimes I think I know you very well, and then I realize I have seen only a small part of you. But complexity is a common trait among divine beings, is it not?~
@4450 = ~Perhaps. But do you like me, or are you afraid of me, or... ?~
@4451 = ~I do not think I am all that complex.~
@4452 = ~Sometimes I think I do not know myself.~
@4453 = ~You still haven't told me anything.~
@4454 = ~I like you, I trust you to a great degree, and I admire you sometimes. But I do not like *what* you are - I hate the taint within you, and I fear it. Did you expect any other answer?~
@4455 = ~No, I did not. It would be foolish of you to accept me as I am, with my heritage and taint.~
@4456 = ~Yes, I did, actually! I thought we were friends!~
@4457 = ~It is better than I expected. I appreciate your trust.~
@4458 = ~Thank you for being honest.~
@4459 = ~Then perhaps there is a part of you that you are not aware of. Be careful.~
@4460 = ~Clearly. With a dead god within you, how can you really claim you know yourself?~
@4461 = ~You are my friend, I accept you the way you are, and I appreciate our friendship. But I wish Bhaal was not a part of it.~
@4462 = ~I appreciate our friendship. Still, I fear the day will come when your taint will break free and doom it, myself, yourself, and the world.~
@4463 = ~It is inevitable. No Bhaalspawn can expect longevity, and no moonblade wielder can, either. We are doomed, melamin, and you know of it already. But I appreciate the sentiment.~
@4464 = ~It was not a sentiment, but a threat! I warn you: if you get killed, do not come home!~
@4465 = ~Don't you see that I am afraid for you?~
@4466 = ~Just do don't do anything foolish, like shielding me in battle.~
@4467 = ~It was all I wanted to say. Let us move on.~
@4468 = ~(chuckle) This I can promise safely, I suppose.~
@4469 = ~Of course. (sigh) I promise, I will try not to die, if I can help it.~
@4470 = ~I am here for you. I cannot promise that I will stand aside and let you handle our battles, and neither can I promise that everything will be all right, but we have each other today, now. Isn't it...~
@4471 = ~... fabulous?~
@4472 = ~... wonderful?~
@4473 = ~... unbelievable?~
@4474 = ~... doomed?~
@4475 = ~I do not know, what?~
@4476 = ~(remain silent)~
@4477 = ~Absolutely. And much more than that.~
@4478 = ~(sigh) Ah, <CHARNAME>, <CHARNAME>...~
@4479 = ~Incredible beyond words, I suppose.~
@4480 = ~... terrible. Ah. Oh, Seldarine, I meant to say differently, but when I saw that frown on your face... (sigh) It is wonderful, <CHARNAME>. Wonderful beyond words.~
@4481 = ~So, doomed as we are, perhaps we can enjoy life, as well? Cautiously.~
@4482 = ~Xan, talking about enjoying life? Let me check your forehead...~
@4483 = ~Now I see that we are definitely doomed.~
@4484 = ~Just don't die. Please...~
@4485 = ~And some ice cream sounds like a good start!~
@4486 = ~Yes! Li-i-i-i-ife! I am coming to enjoy youuuu!~
@4487 = ~Oh, I am fine... relatively well... considering the circumstances, anyway. Come. After all, shouldn't I finally find you some flowers, at long last?~
@4488 = ~(sigh) <CHARNAME>...~
@4489 = ~I do not know what to say. You can imagine that I do not want to die - and that I want to shelter you. But I cannot foresee what your destiny deals us both.~
@4490 = ~Definitely. Ah, it is such a pity I have to take care of my voice - otherwise I'd join you without hesitation. But I will keep you company in any case.~
@4491 = ~She pays little heed to the danger, and less to advice. (sigh) And throws caution to the winds, I should add.~
@4492 = ~But I'll gladly accompany you, regardless. Come. After all, shouldn't I finally find you some flowers, at long last?~
@4493 = ~To lose me? <CHARNAME>, what frightens you so?~
@4494 = ~Death, of course.~
@4495 = ~Your bond with Evereska. You will return there, will you not?~
@4496 = ~You. You are going to abandon me, aren't you?~
@4497 = ~Other women.~
@4498 = ~I will die one day, regardless. And soon. After all, a quest for Irenicus' head is not a serene walk in the park by far. You should be more afraid of your own fate.~
@4499 = ~But I am afraid of yours.~
@4500 = ~I am, but I will be saddened by your death.~
@4501 = ~Without you, I won't care.~
@4502 = ~I appreciate it. But it is pointless.~
@4503 = ~(sigh) I think I will not be overly fond of it, either. Thank you... for caring.~
@4504 = ~Do not say this. If you do not care, others will. Just look at... oh, never mind.~
@4505 = ~Yes, I shall - after Irenicus lies defeated. We shall see what happens then, but... yes, most certainly I shall - to report about my mission, if nothing else, for it is my duty. Why?~
@4506 = ~I want to come with you, but I cannot.~
@4507 = ~I will miss you.~
@4508 = ~No reason.~
@4509 = ~Ah. I see...~
@4510 = ~I want to remain with you. And perhaps we will find a way. But... honestly, <CHARNAME>, don't you think it is all pointless?~
@4511 = ~I am afraid of your heritage, you know this, and so I am afraid to give promises. Yet, I follow you, and I feel for you. If it is not enough...~
@4512 = ~It is.~
@4513 = ~No, it is not.~
@4514 = ~I do not know.~
@4515 = ~Thank you.~
@4516 = ~... there is little I can do. It will take you only a few words to be rid of my attention, though.~
@4517 = ~I do not know, either.~
@4518 = ~(snort) Yes, Athkatlan ladies of dubious behavior are all incarnations of my innermost dream, I doubt it not. <CHARNAME>, death or duty I could understand, but this?~
@4519 = ~Well, you never know.~
@4520 = ~Still waters run deep, they say.~
@4521 = ~What about beautiful ladies of Evereska?~
@4522 = ~What about a certain someone who travels with us?~
@4523 = ~Oh, yes, there are several skeletons of female persuasion in my backpack, I am sure. And a wide assortment of various pictures. (sigh) Insufferable...~
@4524 = ~Indeed, they are beautiful. But I am afraid I will have to disappoint you again.~
@4525 = ~Much as it might disappoint you: no, thank you. And I am sure the lady will answer the same.~
@4526 = ~<CHARNAME>, I feel for you, and you alone. By now, you should have gotten used to it, don't you think?~
@4527 = ~(Touch Xan's ear)~
@4528 = ~(Startled, Xan jumps a good few feet away.)~
@4529 = ~<CHARNAME>, what has gotten into you?~
@4530 = ~Mmm... no. Don't... do... it. Don't.~
@4531 = ~(Xan raises his head as your fingers brush past his ear tip.)~
@4532 = ~What is it you are trying to say?~
@4533 = ~(sigh) Child... do you even know *what* you are doing? Or do you want me to show you?~
@4534 = ~(He shakes his head, sighs and very pointedly covers his ears with his hair.)~
@4535 = ~(Apparently without thinking, Xan's fingers stretch towards your ear in return.)~
@4536 = ~(The caress is slow and soft, two fingers gliding down the curve of your ear, light, warm, relaxed sensation enveloping your body almost immediately.)~
@4537 = ~(His fingers hesitantly slide onto your cheek, where they rest for a moment, and you see Xan looking at you strangely, almost greedily, drinking in your image. Then he drops his hand and wordlessly offers you his arm.)~
@4538 = ~(Xan stands absolutely still, either unwilling to react or unable to. His arms fall helplessly, his eyes close... but he jerks his head sharply and comes awake at once.)~
@4539 = ~<CHARNAME>, either you need me alive or you do not. And if you do, do not do this again.~
@4540 = ~(Xan utters a deep sigh and slowly turns to you.)~
@4541 = ~In case you are not aware, our ears are very... sensitive. Let me show you...~
@4542 = ~(He carefully draws you close, and calmly starts stroking your ears. All the while, his face remains undisturbed, as if you two were researching a mildly interesting spell.)~
@4543 = ~(Your body and face, however, do not seem to share his self-control, and you feel the most peculiar sensations starting to flood your body. Shivers run down your chest and spine, your body feels feather-light, your eyes widen and your lips part on their own accord.)~
@4544 = ~(Xan steps back, gently supporting you by the shoulders, and gives you an ironic smile.) Do forgive me, but I wanted to get my point across. Now you see, don't you?~
@4545 = ~(Xan slowly brings his hand up, gently dislodges yours and kisses it.)~
@4546 = ~Do not. You are severely changing my spellcasting ability this way, and I would prefer to be able to defend you. I...~
@4547 = ~(sigh) I care for you. Doomed as you are...~
@4548 = ~(Xan gives a soft cry and looks up in some surprise. Noticing you, he visibly stiffens and moves on without a word... but not fast enough to conceal the deep pink spreading up his cheeks.)~
@4549 = ~Seldarine... no, 'insufferable' is not the word. 'Doomed' is more likely, and I am doomed with you. <CHARNAME>, what are you doing to me?~
@4550 = ~(Stroke Xan's ear)~
@4551 = ~Aah... a'maelamin, ale' lye tela... later... after. You know I cannot take this now.~
@4552 = ~(Xan inclines his head very slowly and turns in your direction, a blissful half-smile on his face. Somehow - has the thought come to you through the bond you share? - you get the feeling that he has surrendered all control of his body to you, his usual guard and defences down.)~
@4553 = ~(For the short stretch of time in which your fingers caress his ear, Xan's breathing stops altogether.)~
@4554 = ~(Xan takes a deep breath and pulls you very close.)~
@4555 = ~Seldarine... do you know how much I... ?~
@4556 = ~(You never get to hear what he wanted to say, as Xan stops abruptly, and starts kissing you more and more insistently, and the world gets lost in a blurred tangle of shapes and sensations.)~
@4557 = ~(As your fingers travel down the tip of his pointed ear, Xan leans back slightly, seemingly trying to master the will to shake you off and to be closer to you at the same time. Finally, the final impulse wins, and he turns to scoop you in his arms... only to end up collapsing in front of you.)~
@4558 = ~(He looks up, blinking and apparently trying to clear his head.) Overwhelming... You are becoming a better enchanter than I, my dear. Perhaps... perhaps you will teach me a trick or two at a later time?~
@4559 = ~(sigh) My teasing <CHARNAME>. Haven't I told you how strongly our kind reacts to this simple caress? Or is it precisely because you know... ?~
@4560 = ~(He kisses you gently.) But while this may be the perfect time for you, I would disagree.~
@4561 = ~(You brush his long, flowing hair aside, and touch his pointed ear. Xan looks calm all the while... all too calm, you realize, as - )~
@4562 = ~(All of a sudden, he whips around and, in a quick move, your arms are pinned to the sides.)~
@4563 = ~(sigh) I was never much of a villain, but if I let my imagination run away with you... 

... it will never return. But I shall risk it anyway.~
@4564 = ~(He slowly, very deliberately takes one small step forward, and you can only watch as his lips approach your face... your cheek... and disappear out of sight, as they touch the very tip of your ear and travel down with agonizing slowness.)~
@4565 = ~(And the world explodes.)~
@4566 = ~Stop - ~
@4567 = ~(sigh) Too late. <CHARNAME>, in case you did not notice, I was reciting an incantation. Not that you care, of course.~
@4568 = ~But - since the spell is lost anyway - I think you may as well go on, no?~
@4569 = ~(His smile is almost mischievous.)~
@4570 = ~(Xan closes his eyes, takes your free hand in his and kisses it.)~
@4571 = ~(sigh) If you are even *thinking* on nibbling it, think again, for I can easily do the same. And then what will you do, here and now? I would wait for the time to rest.~
@4572 = ~Although I seem to recall you were fond of resting in most peculiar places in Baldur's Gate. In which case, we are doomed.~
@4573 = ~Could your moonblade be holding more enchantments within itself?~
@4574 = ~Do you think you will be able to awaken your moonblade's hidden potential?~
@4575 = ~I wonder, have you considered a romantic relationship with a certain someone?~
@4576 = ~It is done.~ [O#XAN000]
@4577 = ~Who can say now, why, but the blade has deemed me worthy, after all.~
@4578 = ~Corellon... it is a miracle.~
@4579 = ~Oh, don't be so dramatic! Here, let me have a look.~
@4580 = ~A miracle indeed. You even look taller.~
@4581 = ~Wonderful. Congratulations, Xan!~
@4582 = ~All right, let us go.~
@4583 = ~Wait! This is a moonblade - have you forgotten? I do not want you hurt.~
@4584 = ~Do I? Oh, <CHARNAME>... flatterer.~
@4585 = ~Thank you. It means a lot to be alive, you know.~
@4586 = ~Of course.~
@4587 = ~I appreciate your support - after all, would I have dared to step forward without it? But still... who would've thought...~
@4588 = ~Seldarine... I think I am happy.~
@4589 = ~Wh-what?~
@4590 = ~Why would you ask such a thing?~
@4591 = ~Because I am attracted to you.~
@4592 = ~Because I think you and a certain someone will look good together.~
@4593 = ~Well, since both you and Aerie are elves...~
@4594 = ~You know of whom I speak!~
@4595 = ~No reason. Just curious.~
@4596 = ~To hear it from you - mellonamin, it is a compliment indeed.~
@4597 = ~But... (sigh) I am ashamed to admit this, but I do not want to lose your friendship, not for anything else. It is precious to me - indeed, I do not remember whether I ever felt so content.~
@4598 = ~So, if you please, we shall leave it at that. And, before you ask - no, there is nobody else.~
@4599 = ~<CHARNAME>, you flatter me. But it is a pointless discussion, and it leads to nowhere.~
@4600 = ~I think you and I have discussed the matter already, have we not? But I shall repeat myself, if you wish.~
@4601 = ~<CHARNAME>, we are companions. Friends. I respect you greatly, despite and because of your heritage.~
@4602 = ~But, once and for all, I would ask you to stay out of my private life. Besides - what answer would you expect? A confession? A story about my abilities and the unceasing temptation to use them on unsuspecting elven maidens? Another story of love unrequited?~
@4603 = ~If I suddenly, inexplicably, fall in love, and the lady will return the favor, you will be the first person who will be made aware of it, and invited to the subsequent wedding. Or, considering the circumstances, the funeral. Fair enough?~
@4604 = ~Fair enough. Heh.~
@4605 = ~I think so. You can expect the same from me, by the way.~
@4606 = ~No. I want to know more.~
@4607 = ~Could you at least tell me her name?~
@4608 = ~... I will ask you to stop embarrassing yourself, myself, and the lady in question.~
@4609 = ~Excellent. Now, if you haven't forgotten, we have a mission to perform. Or have you finally realized how pointless it all is?~
@4610 = ~Oh, I do not doubt it. *You* wouldn't pass on the chance, would you?~
@4611 = ~There is nothing - nothing - that you would know.~
@4612 = ~Besides, honestly, <CHARNAME>: what is the point?~
@4613 = ~With a woman I am bonded to? Certainly. If only she and I were not doomed, I might even have considered myself blissfully happy.~
@4614 = ~I love you, too.~
@4615 = ~Me, too.~
@4616 = ~I am happy regardless. With you, how can I not be?~
@4617 = ~Xan, we are NOT doomed!~
@4618 = ~I do not think I am happy, no.~
@4619 = ~I meant someone in my stead.~
@4620 = ~Well, there is always place for someone else...~
@4621 = ~I love you. I love you so much...~
@4622 = ~Please, tell Irenicus this, when you meet him. I am sure he will appreciate the joke.~
@4623 = ~Now, your question answered, shall we go? Or would you prefer to... keep considering... for a little while?~
@4624 = ~I am sorry. But then you meant... ?~
@4625 = ~<CHARNAME>, if I can do something to make you happier, tell me so. If you want to send me away, tell me so. But do not think I could replace you in my heart. It is a hopeless cause, I'm afraid.~
@4626 = ~Hasn't it occurred to you that I might feel... involved... already?~
@4627 = ~Oh. With whom?~
@4628 = ~And is the lady in question aware of that?~
@4629 = ~Do you mean us?~
@4630 = ~(sigh) With a reckless, teasing, insufferable but nevertheless charming young lady, who is too brilliant to notice my rather insignificant presence at times.~
@4631 = ~I dare say she is, judging by the way she is looking at me at the mo... oh. Never mind.~
@4632 = ~<CHARNAME>... you speak as if you did not know. But you do, you very well do, don't you?~
@4633 = ~Who are you taking me for, I wonder? <CHARNAME>... enough of this. I do hope it is a joke.~
@4634 = ~You remember that I was attracted to you during our... earlier travels. Can you imagine me having a change of heart so quickly thereafter?~
@4635 = ~<CHARNAME>, stop. Don't.~
@4636 = ~I believe I have told you about this before, have I not?~
@4637 = ~The blade has been in my family for generations. It is ancient, and powerful - more powerful that it reveals itself to be, now, this much is true. The blade adjusts to the wielder's persona, and, as such, I can only use the abilities it grants me - no more, no less.~
@4638 = ~Does it mean that in another elf's hands it could be more powerful?~
@4639 = ~In other words, you use it as it deems fit to be used.~
@4640 = ~Could you persuade it to reveal more of its hidden potential to you, then?~
@4641 = ~I see.~
@4642 = ~I do not know. Perhaps - there is no possible way of knowing, unless I die and another claims the blade in my stead. I have hope you would not want this to happen soon, however.~
@4643 = ~In terms of enchantments, yes.~
@4644 = ~At times of great need, the blade can grant additional protection to its wielder, or more edge in battle, perhaps. It is not unheard of. But such cases are truly... exceptional, and I am not that unique among my kind. I am sorry, <CHARNAME>.~
@4645 = ~But you are a powerful mage on a mission of great importance, aren't you? Perhaps your blade shall recognize it.~
@4646 = ~You have come a long way as a moonblade wielder. Won't it acknowledge your prowess?~
@4647 = ~You have nothing to be sorry for. I was just asking, after all.~
@4648 = ~Yes, it is a pity.~
@4649 = ~I know. But... perhaps...~
@4650 = ~No. I am aiding you, a Bhaalspawn; our actions are such that sometimes I am not sure my blade will not burn me on the spot - associating with the Shadow Thieves and Corellon knows whom else!~
@4651 = ~And I am an outcast... have always been. Do you know that originally wielding a moonblade meant being gifted with the potential to reign; carrying the seed of kings and queens? But this cannot be: not in my case. I am insignificant - I am doomed.~
@4652 = ~Yet... somehow, this does not seem to be impossible, now that you say this.~
@4653 = ~I must think... Please, leave me be for a while. It shall not take long.~
@4654 = ~And in any case, my progress has been laughable. I still need to come a long way to even consider the possibility.~
@4655 = ~I am sorry, <CHARNAME>. I truly am.~
@4656 = ~My moonblade's... ?~
@4657 = ~I have indeed given it some thought... and I believe I am ready to ask the blade - to petition Corellon himself - for this boon.~
@4658 = ~It is terrifying, though, is it not? I almost feel a green youth again, ready to step forward and to claim the blade... or die.~
@4659 = ~But I am no longer one, am I? Doomed or not, I am a moonfighter, pledged to the service of my people.~
@4660 = ~I am ready.~
@4661 = ~(sigh) <CHARNAME>. I have told you already, haven't I? You are way too impatient: there's no point trying to run before you can walk, and our position is precarious indeed.~
@4662 = ~But, strangely enough, I am beginning to get certain this time may come. Ask me again some way down the road... that is, if we still live.~
@4663 = ~Oh.~ [O#XAN039]
@4664 = ~Somehow, I am not surprised.~
@4665 = ~And what is that supposed to mean?~
@4666 = ~Surprised by what?~
@4667 = ~... that we are trapped here?~
@4668 = ~... that the Shadow Pack left?~
@4669 = ~... that the Dungeon Crawlers left?~
@4670 = ~... that we were drugged and left here for some nefarious purpose?~
@4671 = ~Yes, yes. Come on, let's move.~
@4672 = ~Resistance is futile, I suppose.~
@4673 = ~Was that a rhetorical question?~
@4674 = ~Exactly.~
@4675 = ~Look around. If you still think we are not doomed... (groan) You are thinking exactly this, aren't you?~
@4676 = ~Of course! Let me prove it to you.~
@4677 = ~Actually, I think we might be.~
@4678 = ~I do not know. Shall we find out?~
@4679 = ~You do not look afraid at all.~
@4680 = ~By doing what? Killing a golem, wrestling with a troll, silencing a lich? (sigh) Though, come to think of it, you might be capable of doing just that.~
@4681 = ~You do? This is inspiring.~
@4682 = ~Oh, I do not doubt that we shall. Sooner, rather than later.~
@4683 = ~Resigned is the word, I suppose. After all, what can I do - now? The harm has been done already.~
@4684 = ~Still, I do not like this. All abandoned fortresses and citadels tend to swiftly attract monstrous would-be inhabitants. Take care, please. We have been brought here for someone, and this someone is very likely alive and waiting for us.~
@4685 = ~Of course, Xan. I will take extra care.~
@4686 = ~Shush, you! Come on, we have a dungeon to explore!~
@4687 = ~As usual.~
@4688 = ~Who do you think it might be?~
@4689 = ~I am glad. I would hate to lose you.~
@4690 = ~I am glad. I would hate to lose a friend.~
@4691 = ~(sigh) Yes, yes. I am tripping over my robes in the admirable haste to explore it, I am sure. I would mind the traps, though.~
@4692 = ~Did you mean the monster, or my warning? (sigh) Both, most probably. Come, let us go.~
@4693 = ~I do not know, but I do not like this. I haven't said anything new, have I? But we have no choice, so - come?~
@4694 = ~I cannot bear to think of what you have done.~
@4695 = ~I really do not care about you any more.~
@4696 = ~And I cannot bear to think of what you were forced to do, when you were the Slayer. Do you really feel the need to say more?~
@4697 = ~No, I do not. I have nothing more to say to you.~
@4698 = ~Yes, I do. I hate you. I despise you.~
@4699 = ~I want to talk to you about this.~
@4700 = ~I did not have a choice. You did.~
@4701 = ~No, I am sorry, Xan. I shouldn't have brought this up.~
@4702 = ~As you will.~
@4703 = ~I have expected this. With reason, I suppose. And I think I can imagine some of the things and the names you may come up with - and I do not want to hear them.~
@4704 = ~Or did you expect any other answer?~
@4705 = ~I would prefer not to. Though... if you insist, I will tell you one thing.~
@4706 = ~Well... yes and no.~
@4707 = ~I know, <CHARNAME>... I am sorry, too. And it is hard not to bring up that which haunts your thoughts, isn't it?~
@4708 = ~I never had a choice about feeling what I felt for you a year ago, and still do now. This has never changed, and likely will not. And, in case you are wondering, it is neither pity nor dislike.~
@4709 = ~I have set everything aside to help you regain your soul, at the cost of my life, if need be. But I have chosen not to act on these feelings after your... change, and I will continue to not do so. This is not an excuse - there can be no excuses. But this is my path.~
@4710 = ~You care, or you wouldn't have told me. But in any case, I have nothing to say.~
@4711 = ~Besides, you wouldn't care about my answer, would you?~ 
@4712 = ~<CHARNAME>, what is it that I hear about you and Hendak?~
@4713 = ~I would rather it was a lie, but I am *rather* afraid it is not. I think... I shall leave you alone.~
@4714 = ~Talk to me again, if... No. Don't.~
@4715 = ~If it is a joke, it is a rather unpleasant one, don't you find?~
@4716 = ~Well, I slept with him, and I am not going to explain myself further. Take it as you will.~
@4717 = ~It is... it is a just rumor, Xan, and you will not hear anything of the sort again.~
@4718 = ~It is more than a joke: it is an outright lie.~
@4719 = ~I am sorry. Xan, I am sorry.~
@4720 = ~Talk to me again, when you come to your senses.~
@4721 = ~Thank you for reassuring me, melamin. I hope we will not hear of this again - it hurts rather more than it should, does it not?~
@4722 = ~Are you?~
@4723 = ~It would seem that you had an eventful night.~ [O#XAN000]
@4724 = ~Yes, I did.~
@4725 = ~I was not myself yesterday. I regret it, now.~
@4726 = ~I had feelings for Coran, long ago. It seems they did not die entirely.~
@4727 = ~So I see.~
@4728 = ~We need to recover your soul, or something much worse may well happen. This is not you, <CHARNAME>... not you at all.~
@4729 = ~Come. I do not think I can stand it if we stay here for much longer. Forest of Tethyr does not feel... healthy at the moment.~
@4730 = ~Xan, about Solaufein...~
@4731 = ~Saemon. (groan) Who is the next? Irenicus?~ [O#XAN000]
@4732 = ~Mmm... maybe!~
@4733 = ~No, no. Saemon was quite enough.~
@4734 = ~I know, I know. But he is such a charming scoundrel... I could not refuse the opportunity!~
@4735 = ~Would you believe me if I said it was the worst mistake of my life?~
@4736 = ~But it was just one night! I will never see him again after this journey!~
@4737 = ~It is hopeless.~
@4738 = ~I do not want to hear about it.~
@4739 = ~Yes, of course. But does it make it any better?~
@4740 = ~I am attributing it to the loss of your soul. But... I might just stop.~
@4741 = ~I have noticed that you wince whenever anyone mentions the Copper Coronet.~
@4742 = ~Xan, you have been looking frosty for some time now, so I think you know what happened in the Mithrest Inn. We'd better talk.~
@4743 = ~This is... I... yes.~
@4744 = ~About a young paladin who was seeking adventures and found them? Excuse me, but I rather detest this particular topic, and have no desire to discuss it further.~
@4745 = ~Good. I knew what I was doing.~
@4746 = ~Well, I do! I want to explain.~
@4747 = ~I... I am sorry, Xan.~
@4748 = ~Is it about that night, then?~
@4749 = ~I am curious. How did you found out?~
@4750 = ~Only too well, it seems.~
@4751 = ~(sigh) So am I, you can be sure of that.~
@4752 = ~Don't. I do not want to know, I do not want to listen about how you - oh, <CHARNAME>...~
@4753 = ~Let us just... forget this.~
@4754 = ~Yes, strange as it may seem, this time it is not about Irenicus, your heritage, or my moonblade.~
@4755 = ~Yes, you have endangered our position with this foolish demand. But I have no right to complain, so I won't. I just pray we - you - will make it out of here, alive. If Solaufein helps us in the end, it is all worth it.~
@4756 = ~Thank you.~
@4757 = ~I hope so, too.~
@4758 = ~I did not sleep with him. I sent him away.~
@4759 = ~I see. This is... a relief.~
@4760 = ~Perhaps this is my disguise speaking, not me, but I will say it nevertheless: if he hurts you, I will kill him.~
@4761 = ~I want to talk to you about Ribald.~
@4762 = ~Ribald? Only Ribald, and no one else? There is no need to be so modest about your conquests, <CHARNAME>.~
@4763 = ~You are bitter, and I do not want this.~
@4764 = ~Haven't it occurred to you that *you* might be lacking?~
@4765 = ~Are you actually jealous? It's all new experience.~
@4766 = ~Yes, only Ribald.~
@4767 = ~Do I want this?~
@4768 = ~But that I have always known this.~
@4769 = ~Oh, of that I have no doubt. During the past tenday, I have discovered entire new realms within myself, and not all of them benevolent.~
@4770 = ~Only him. Very well, then, so be it.~
@4771 = ~I suppose I should be glad that you have time, energy and inclination to comfort someone else, to laugh with someone else - and to sleep with someone else, of course - I shouldn't shy from mentioning this.~
@4772 = ~But I am not. And if you think me this unselfish, you are flattering me.~
@4773 = ~I think I love you.~
@4774 = ~What can I do?~
@4775 = ~I am sorry. I have feelings for you... but I do not want to deny myself this.~
@4776 = ~I do regret it. Will you give me a second chance?~
@4777 = ~Then, perhaps, we should part.~
@4778 = ~Be here for me. For a day, for an hour, for a moment. It makes life... worthwhile, somehow.~
@4779 = ~(sigh) Do you wish to doom me further? But you know I will abide by your wishes.~
@4780 = ~I am here for you, for as long as I live. It would be foolish to deny this. But you do know it hurts, don't you?~
@4781 = ~You will do as you see fit, and I do not wish to discuss it. But you do know it hurts, don't you?~
@4782 = ~(Xan embraces you and raises his head upwards, facing the rain.)~ [O#XAN000]
@4783 = ~They say that the rain can wash away everything. The past... the present... everything you want washed away. Who do you want to be now, <CHARNAME>? Decide.~
@4784 = ~I want to be... me.~
@4785 = ~The ruler of this world.~
@4786 = ~Someone insignificant.~
@4787 = ~Not a Bhaalspawn.~
@4788 = ~Someone else. Not myself.~
@4789 = ~And I want to be with you.~
@4790 = ~Cyric believed himself one, I trust. Or was it your father? (sigh) My knowledge of the human pantheon is still lacking, though I spent some time in the libraries after a certain discovery.~
@4791 = ~Like me? But it will be a welcome change to you, I doubt it not. Bhaalspawn the Great... <CHARNAME> the insignificant... and beautiful.~
@4792 = ~With your uncanny ability to make enemies where'er you go, I very much doubt it would make you less doomed. But I wish it were true.~
@4793 = ~Oh, I see. We could switch bodies, I suppose... were I strong enough to restrain your taint. But that would be too... strange, especially at night... don't you think?~
@4794 = ~No matter. Let us just... listen.~
@4795 = ~A rain of rain is so much better than a rain of enemies. (sigh) <CHARNAME>... my <CHARNAME>... how can I keep you safe?~
@4796 = ~Shhh, dear, it's all right.~
@4797 = ~I'll keep us both safe. Promise.~
@4798 = ~I don't need safety.~
@4799 = ~Just be here.~
@4800 = ~I don't know.~
@4801 = ~Indeed? I very much doubt it, Estel'amin. Even hope fades. But I love you.~
@4802 = ~What is it you need, then? A storm? Here it comes.~
@4803 = ~I am here. A poor shelter, I once said.... but yours.~
@4804 = ~I don't know either. I have nothing, and even hope fades. But I love you.~
@4805 = ~Rain...~
@4806 = ~(Xan gasps and clutches your hand, as a rainbow appears in the sky.)~ [O#XAN000]
@4807 = ~Have you never seen a rainbow?~
@4808 = ~A good sign, isn't it?~
@4809 = ~What?~
@4810 = ~Yes... no... I don't...~
@4811 = ~I am sorry, I... saw the rainbow and thought of a day long, long ago.~
@4812 = ~Twenty years ago I was standing by the bank of a river. It was late evening, the land was basking in the soft glow, the leaves were green and alive, the rainbow has just faded from the sky, and everything was achingly fresh and beautiful.~
@4813 = ~And I was alone.~
@4814 = ~Go on.~
@4815 = ~It hurt, I suppose.~
@4816 = ~What happened then?~
@4817 = ~(remain silent)~
@4818 = ~It did not hurt at first - why should it? But then I imagined myself standing far below, watching the river hand in hand with... no, I did not know you then, but my visions were close enough... and I despaired. Knowing that everything was hopeless was one thing; feeling it was rather unbearable.~
@4819 = ~But then the rainbow sparkled one last time - inside of me. And all of a sudden I felt hope and happiness, when I thought of things to come. It lasted only a minute, and I cannot explain how it came, but I knew love, nevertheless.~
@4820 = ~What it might have been I will never know. But I know you, and now, today it feels just as it did then.~
@4821 = ~Not just as it did. Better.~
@4822 = ~What, you are still miserable, hmm?~
@4823 = ~I felt as you do, once.~
@4824 = ~I had a similar feeling, once. In Nashkel, by the river, at sunset.~
@4825 = ~A premonition of love. Well, that's only fair, given that you mostly see death ahead!~
@4826 = ~Much better... ah, <CHARNAME>... I could never hope.~
@4827 = ~Oh, I will be in a moment, never fear. But not now.~
@4828 = ~We are alike in many things. We always have been, perhaps.~
@4829 = ~Certainly, make fun of this doomed enchanter, but it was a happy moment. As is this one.~
@4830 = ~Come here, closer... I want to tell you something, and it is for your ears alone.~
@4831 = ~An elven bond is a strange thing. It stretches to the past and to the future. Who knows what may happen to us? But even if we should fall... in each other's hearts, we never truly die.~
@4832 = ~Deep in every heart, there is always a rainbow.~
@4833 = ~(The setting sun casts a peaceful glow over Xan's face, and it looks almost serene. At length, he sighs.)~ [O#XAN000]
@4834 = ~The night will fall very soon. Why is this that all wondrous things fade so quickly?~
@4835 = ~Because they are doomed.~
@4836 = ~Life is hollow, Xan, remember? It is full of suffering, and short stretches of peace and beauty are only there to remind us how miserable we are.~
@4837 = ~Not all of them. And night has its beauty, too.~
@4838 = ~Otherwise they would become boring and mundane.~
@4839 = ~I cannot say.~
@4840 = ~You jest again; and you are right, <CHARNAME>, whether you wanted to be right or not. But one sunset... this sunset... I want it to be an exception.~
@4841 = ~True enough, I suppose. But one sunset... this sunset... I want it to be an exception.~
@4842 = ~Each time a sunset fades, I think of another day of happiness gone. And there are not many left.~
@4843 = ~But there is a place where sunset is eternal, where you can stand and watch it to your heart's content, if you would, and even afterwards - a little. Childish, isn't it? You know the place.~
@4844 = ~Yes, I do.~
@4845 = ~Another plane?~
@4846 = ~Somewhere on Toril, perhaps?~
@4847 = ~Arvandor.~
@4848 = ~No, I don't.~
@4849 = ~Arvandor, yes... the Blessed Realm.~
@4850 = ~What? I thought you knew; Arborea, Arvanaith, Arvandor is the word.~
@4851 = ~It soothes the troubled spirit, and it is unconceivable that an elf would not want to return to its ancient forest home - the city of trees. And we are both denied it. So ironic.~
@4852 = ~But does being of one heart not matter more than living forever? And is a real, fleeting sunset not more beautiful than an eternal glow in one of the corners of the Blessed Realm?~
@4853 = ~I do not know, Xan. I am scared of death.~
@4854 = ~You speak as if you have made your choice.~
@4855 = ~An eternity in paradise is appealing. But not so without you.~
@4856 = ~Love matters more, but do I have a choice?~
@4857 = ~I do not know. How can I compare?~
@4858 = ~It is not only unfair - it is monstrous that you have only now, and I may have both. Still, your choice is important. You remember the prophecies - have they taken love into account?~
@4859 = ~Forgive me this lament. I am happy: I am yet alive, the sunset is not yet gone, and I am yet with you... no. No. Simply: I am with you.~
@4860 = ~I have, but I almost feel as if it was made for me. Could I choose otherwise, with your hand in mine?~
@4861 = ~And entirely so without you.~
@4862 = ~(Xan's eyes shine as he turns towards the rising sun.)~ [O#XAN000]
@4863 = ~A sunrise carries the Seldarine's blessing. And a proof that we are not dead yet.~
@4864 = ~Between you and me, I am far more grateful for the latter.~
@4865 = ~And for your company, of course. Come, let us face the inevitable together.~
@4866 = ~(Xan gives a shiver and wraps his hands in the cloak.)~ [O#XAN000]
@4867 = ~Why do I get the feeling this night shall be our last?~
@4868 = ~I don't know, but I am not surprised.~
@4869 = ~Because we are in danger, and have been for some time.~
@4870 = ~This doesn't sound very romantic.~
@4871 = ~Because such is your nature.~
@4872 = ~Are you going to use the 'we are doomed anyway, so let us come together for the last time' approach?~
@4873 = ~(sigh) Yes, I tend to be predictable, for better or for worse.~
@4874 = ~Death normally isn't.~
@4875 = ~Yes, but it might be slightly more than that. This chill is unhealthy.~
@4876 = ~No, but the idea is tempting. In fact...~
@4877 = ~No, no, now is not the time.~
@4878 = ~I'd like to find ourselves near a warm fire. Someone will be strumming a lute, someone - sampling a bottle of wine, you'll be curled up by my side, and no shadow would pass over us...~
@4879 = ~Oooh, yes!~
@4880 = ~I picture this somewhat differently, but I agree in the essentials.~
@4881 = ~That's nice. I would like that.~
@4882 = ~Certainly! We could arrange a rest now, if you wish.~
@4883 = ~Boring. Let's go and kill something.~
@4884 = ~But your enemies will not disappear, alas. Nay, melamin, it is hopeless.~
@4885 = ~However... I think I know something we could do to dispel this dismal mood.~
@4886 = ~It wasn't dismal until you said it was.~
@4887 = ~And what would it be?~
@4888 = ~I am listening.~
@4889 = ~(sigh) As long as it is not another lich, dragon, beholder, or whatever have you... but it would be too good to hope for, wouldn't it?~
@4890 = ~Perhaps so.~
@4891 = ~(Xan draws you close and kisses you silently.)~
@4892 = ~(As you melt into a tight embrace, you feel the tips of his fingers growing warmer against your cheek.)~
@4893 = ~<CHARNAME>...~
@4894 = ~Mmmm... more!~
@4895 = ~Yes?~
@4896 = ~That's me.~
@4897 = ~Time to go, don't you think?~
@4898 = ~(He very tenderly kisses you again.)~
@4899 = ~I love you.~
@4900 = ~Nothing. Nothing I would say rather than...~
@4901 = ~I know.~
@4902 = ~(Xan's hand finds yours, and another hand touches the tip of your ear and slowly glides along its length.)~ [O#XAN000]
@4903 = ~I do not suppose... ?~
@4904 = ~Not now.~
@4905 = ~Hmm... why not?~
@4906 = ~Do continue...~
@4907 = ~What do you have in mind?~
@4908 = ~I cannot pretend I am not disappointed, so I won't. Come?~
@4909 = ~Danger, darkness... it should repel me, but here, now, it is intoxicating.~
@4910 = ~I want to take you in my arms and forget that anything else exists. And I want you to desire the same.~
@4911 = ~But I already do.~
@4912 = ~Yes.~
@4913 = ~(Kiss him)~
@4914 = ~I do not think so.~
@4915 = ~Perhaps later.~
@4916 = ~Then we are one...~
@4917 = ~(A sun ray glides over you and disappears in Xan's palm.)~ [O#XAN000]
@4918 = ~(He mutters something, stretches his fingers in your direction... and all of a sudden, you are the target of a small shower of golden sparks.)~
@4919 = ~Hey, stop it!~
@4920 = ~Haha! Behold, for you are now the target of my wicked magics! (repeat his spell)~
@4921 = ~Sparks! *My* fireworks are loads better!~
@4922 = ~What are you doing?~
@4923 = ~Ah, this feels good! Thank you!~
@4924 = ~Hmm? What are you talking about, I wonder?~
@4925 = ~This!~
@4926 = ~Your magic, of course!~
@4927 = ~Stop pretending! You very well know what I am talking about!~
@4928 = ~Why, nothing whatsoever, of course.~
@4929 = ~Oh dear, now I am overwhelmed... <CHARNAME>! Not the spellbook, they are dangerous when they're sizzling like that... ah. Too late.~
@4930 = ~It doesn't look like it's been damaged. But it felt nice.~
@4931 = ~What? What has happened?~
@4932 = ~Can we mend it?~
@4933 = ~I hoped you would enjoy this. A welcome change from fire arrows and domination spells, is it not?~
@4934 = ~Oh, yes!~
@4935 = ~I think so.~
@4936 = ~I was annoyed a little, though.~
@4937 = ~But is it safe?~
@4938 = ~This is very light magic. It should be harmless, and surprisingly...yes, everything looks as it should. No damages, and only pleasant memories... I hope.~
@4939 = ~Very pleasant.~
@4940 = ~Quite so.~
@4941 = ~And it is good to see you smile, too!~
@4942 = ~No, I did not enjoy that.~
@4943 = ~(sigh) I am sorry, <CHARNAME>. A glass of cool water, then, perhaps? Though what is the point...~
@4944 = ~A day in the life... and some sunshine. What else can one wish for?~
@4945 = ~Bed?~
@4946 = ~Invincibility!~
@4947 = ~Shall I give you a list?~
@4948 = ~Gold, jewels, and the best magical weapons in Amn!~
@4949 = ~You!~
@4950 = ~Nothing.~
@4951 = ~And breakfast to bed, I trust? Very well, I'll remember that.~
@4952 = ~And resistance is futile, I take it? <CHARNAME>, I am not a magician... oh, Seldarine, I am, am I? (sigh) I am doomed.~
@4953 = ~(sigh) Somehow, I knew you would say that. Ribald will expect you with welcoming arms, I gather.~
@4954 = ~Ah... <CHARNAME>... this is a touch too literal. But I'll remember that.~
@4955 = ~You are matchless in battle. (sigh) But... but...~
@4956 = ~Pay me no heed. I have my wish; I just wish you could have yours.~
@4957 = ~Indeed... nothing. But let us pretend you have not heard me saying that.~
@4958 = ~Come, and let us make this wish come true... eventually.~
@4959 = ~Isn't it true that elves have a song for every rain, snowfall, or sunset? And you are an elf.~
@4960 = ~I do not remember many. I could sing, or dance, I suppose... but what is the point?~
@4961 = ~You are my song.~
@4962 = ~But... oh, very well, <CHARNAME>. I will do my best to entertain you. A rain, a rainbow, a sunset, a sunrise, a night, the stony darkness, a day in full bloom... I may not be sublime enough, but try I will. For you.~
@4963 = ~I do hope I am allowed to draw a line at frolicking in the daisies, however. Now, shall we?~
@4964 = ~Move along.~
@4965 = ~A moonfighter! My lord, you should leave the city immediately!~
@4966 = ~(sigh) Believe me, there is nothing I would rather do.~
@4967 = ~My lord, this is urgent! You must leave, this city is doomed!~
@4968 = ~I fully agree. But wait - you mean something more immediate, do you not?~
@4969 = ~I...~
@4970 = ~What is going on here?~
@4971 = ~Are you trying to tell us something?~
@4972 = ~Enough. Xan, let us go.~
@4973 = ~What in the name of the Seldarine are you doing with this N'Tel'Quess?~
@4974 = ~My tasks demand it, as you might well know. You speak Common, you should understand the need. As well, I hope the concept of friendship is not alien to you.~
@4975 = ~A friend? This vermin?~
@4976 = ~A Na'N'Tel'Quess!~
@4977 = ~I will not tolerate this language.~
@4978 = ~Regardless, this is not what should concern me, and I apologize.~
@4979 = ~My <PRO_LADYLORD>, I am Aegnor of Tethyr.~
@4980 = ~I am <CHARNAME> of Candlekeep.~
@4981 = ~Pleased to make your acquaintance.~
@4982 = ~Do continue.~
@4983 = ~So... why should Xan leave Athkatla?~
@4984 = ~Please, understand me when I say that I cannot reveal anything. I am in no position to! But, I implore you, flee this wretched city at once.~
@4985 = ~Something most... terrible and wondrous for the elven race should transpire here, and soon.~
@4986 = ~What madness is this? Are you planning an attack on Amn by the elven forces, or some such foolishness?~
@4987 = ~Oh, no, my lord. It is much more subtle.~
@4988 = ~In fact, we would welcome your presence. One of the Defenders of Elvendom... you would be most welcome to aid our cause.~
@4989 = ~Should you wish to speak with my betters, meet me in the Government District at night. I shall wait there, and, should you arrive, I will alert them of your coming.~
@4990 = ~I shall be expecting you alone.~
@4991 = ~Though, of course, your esteemed companion may also come, if <PRO_HESHE> wishes it.~
@4992 = ~With that, I take my leave.~
@4993 = ~You have come! Allow me to lead the way.~
@4994 = ~I will take you alone, of course.~
@4995 = ~(quietly) <CHARNAME>, this is not the time to argue. Yet, I'd rather you accompanied us. I will use an invisibility spell on you; this way, they'll be none the wiser.~
@4996 = ~And, please, keep in secret everything that you will have learnt. I trust you will see the importance of it all.~
@4997 = ~Welcome.~
@4998 = ~I am Hiel. Aegnor you already know. Verella and Naiz are our trusted warriors, our cleansing blades. Uluuth Phlarenn.~
@4999 = ~(gasp) Eldreth Veluuthra?~
@5000 = ~Correct.~
@5001 = ~I should have known. We are doomed.~
@5002 = ~You are a champion of our people. Do you have cause to distrust us, or to fear us?~
@5003 = ~Eldreth Veluuthra has done some good for our people, it is true... wherever humans threaten to choke our communities, you work ceaselessly against them. But your methods border on the unacceptable, to say the least.~
@5004 = ~Unacceptable to the humanity at large, perhaps. But to the forests they plundered? The People they abused and murdered? The humans are a blight, which should be removed.~
@5005 = ~I would disagree.~
@5006 = ~It is you who are a blight!~
@5007 = ~An interesting point of view.~
@5008 = ~I fully support this position.~
@5009 = ~(remain silent)~
@5010 = ~You have brought a N'Tel'Quess with you? No matter. We could deal with <PRO_HIMHER> afterwards.~
@5011 = ~Aegnor, Verella - watch <PRO_HIMHER> closely. Kill <PRO_HIMHER> at once, if <PRO_HISHE> becomes a threat.~
@5012 = ~A Na'N'Tel'Quess is, in some ways, a greater blight than a full-blooded human.~
@5013 = ~No!~
@5014 = ~Of course.~
@5015 = ~You judge rashly.~
@5016 = ~And one every elf would do well to consider.~
@5017 = ~You understand! Truly, this meeting is fortuitous for both sides.~
@5018 = ~We are going to cripple these insects once and for all. Athkatla, Baldur's Gate, Waterdeep, Neverwinter, Luskan - many human cities will suffer. And they will not be the last, of course. No, it is only the beginning.~
@5019 = ~What are you planning? Aegnor mentioned it was not an attack... an intrigue, then? A plague? What?~
@5020 = ~You seem genuinely interested. Good.~
@5021 = ~We are going to poison the water supply. No, no, we are not idiots. We do not plan to carry thousands of tons of arsenic for every household. Our plan is more sublime.~
@5022 = ~Poison the water here, and the clerics and the paladins will fall at once. Reach the noble estates, and the city is beheaded. Touch the guard quarters, and panic will erupt. The current Shadowmaster is too well protected, but you could help us in this instance, couldn't you?~
@5023 = ~Repeat this in every human city, and you will see this is a sure path to elven supremacy.~
@5024 = ~You *are* idiots.~
@5025 = ~Murderer!~
@5026 = ~Quite a plan.~
@5027 = ~I do not want to get involved.~
@5028 = ~Weapons at the ready, everyone.~
@5029 = ~In fact... keep an eye on both.~
@5030 = ~I would disagree. I would also advise you to watch your tone.~
@5031 = ~As are you. As is your companion. How many enemies have you killed? How many of them were humans? And would a dozen more truly add to the score?~
@5032 = ~So glad you approve.~
@5033 = ~But you are already involved, and you must make a choice. And what of you, moonblade wielder?~
@5034 = ~What path of supremacy will there be, when the human cities lie in ruin? They will rebuild, and if not, other races will come to pick what is left of them! The drow will not sit idly, either!~
@5035 = ~Our race needs to be cherished, nurtured and prepared for its rebirth, futile though this is. But not this - not like this!~
@5036 = ~So, what are you going to do, moonblade wielder?~
@5037 = ~I should send messages to every city at once... but it would lead to paranoia, and to murders of innocent elves, there can be no doubt about that! I cannot...~
@5038 = ~And there is no need to. Once the deed is done, we are going to place clues which will indicate... hmm... the Cowled Wizards here, in Athkatla. Some civil war will not go amiss.~
@5039 = ~Will you aid us?~
@5040 = ~No.~
@5041 = ~As I thought. You would do well to pass your blade into worthier hands.~
@5042 = ~Yours? You are not supported by the Seldarine! The blade will destroy you!~
@5043 = ~Corellon will answer our prayers... eventually. I will ask you again: will you help us, or will you hinder us?~
@5044 = ~(sigh) I cannot spill the blood of my people. I only hope you realize how pointless it all is. This fanaticism is more suited for humans you so readily despise.~
@5045 = ~I, however, will aid you.~
@5046 = ~I, however, will aid you.~
@5047 = ~Do not listen to him. We will help you.~
@5048 = ~I will not allow you to proceed with this evil.~
@5049 = ~Stand aside, Xan. They are dead.~
@5050 = ~Perhaps we should just forget about this meeting.~
@5051 = ~And you expect me to think that you will not betray us? Your companion has brought you here under false pretenses.~
@5052 = ~However... to bring doom upon N'Tel'Quess at the hands of a N'Tel'Quess... there is certain poetic justice in this.~
@5053 = ~Very well, you will perform for us, and you will be rewarded. Listen to the details of the task.~
@5054 = ~You! Keep your mouth shut in the presence of your betters. You will be disposed of, regardless.~
@5055 = ~I will let you leave, but your companion should be eliminated. After all, <PRO_HESHE> wouldn't be here at all, if not for your indulgence, am I correct?~
@5056 = ~Yes, you are, but I will not allow you to murder <PRO_HIMHER>.~
@5057 = ~You would draw still against your own over a N'Tel'Quess? You have fallen deeper than I have thought.~
@5058 = ~(sigh) Words are futile. If you wish to kill us, do what you must.~
@5059 = ~This is as I hoped. Listen to the details of the task.~
@5060 = ~This is unfortunate. You have fallen deeper than I have thought.~
@5061 = ~I would let you go, but your companion has made <PRO_HISHER> wishes clear.~
@5062 = ~I see.~
@5063 = ~I will let you leave unmolested. You are not to tell anyone what you saw.~
@5064 = ~And, should you alert human authorities, we will take measures.~
@5065 = ~<CHARNAME>... please, consider this. The city will be in chaos - how will you accomplish your goals? What will happen to you, when the authorities discover your connection to these crimes? And what reward can there be, besides a dagger in your throat?~
@5066 = ~A blatant lie. We do not harm our people.~
@5067 = ~Untrue, for we have agents among N'Tel'Quess. You shall be free to go.~
@5068 = ~You are in need of gold, or so I am told? Your victims' funds will provide you with gold and more.~
@5069 = ~But only if you aid this group in murders of hundreds. Would Imoen want that?~
@5070 = ~You are about to battle a powerful mage, or so I am told? Aid us, and Eldreth Veluuthra will come to your aid in Suldanessellar.~
@5071 = ~Destroy one city to save another? What is the point? And will the elves of Suldanessellar want to be associated with this group, when Amnish forces wreak revenge in the land?~
@5072 = ~Will you shut your mouth!~
@5073 = ~I cannot believe that <CHARNAME> may become a part of this. Your group is an embarrassment to us at best.~
@5074 = ~You are more of a hindrance than I have thought. I see only one end to this.~
@5075 = ~Then we shall destroy you.~
@5076 = ~Wait, I do not want to fight! We could still find a solution.~
@5077 = ~Xan is right. I should not aid you, and I shall not.~
@5078 = ~I will aid you. If Xan is a hindrance, we could kill him.~
@5079 = ~Regrettable. Truly.~
@5080 = ~What solution? We must be of one mind, and your companion is clearly not. No, we cannot take such risks.~
@5081 = ~<CHARNAME>! I would prefer if my doom did not come from you, if it is the same to you.~
@5082 = ~You betray trust readily. Too readily for my liking.~
@5083 = ~Besides, killing a moonblade wielder and leaving you alive? Oh, no.~
@5084 = ~Your worthless life shall end just so that we are sure.~
@5085 = ~It does not have to come to this, Hiel.~
@5086 = ~Yet it will - all for your reluctance to do your duty and to aid your race.~
@5087 = ~(sigh) This is futile.~
@5088 = ~You are not worthy. You will not survive. To arms!~
@5089 = ~You made a mistake, <CHARNAME>. Our plans have been revealed, and the city is now prepared, but Eldreth Veluuthra does not forgive!~
@5090 = ~What should we do about Hiel and his plans, Xan?~
@5091 = ~How do you feel, now that Hiel and his companions are dead?~
@5092 = ~(sigh) A difficult question. The consequences will be terrible either way, but... yes, I would report this. I believe it is necessary. Chief Inspector Brega is the one, I suppose.~
@5093 = ~Now, please, let us move on. I do not want to talk about it, and I hope we'll never encounter any members of Eldreth Veluuthra again.~
@5094 = ~This is not the first time I have encountered elves with malevolent intent. Neither it is the first battle with my kin. I am far from all right, but I will manage, thank you. Not today, not tomorrow, but in time. And you, <CHARNAME>?~
@5095 = ~I am fine. Another battle, some good loot.~
@5096 = ~They wanted to kill me; what was I to do?~
@5097 = ~I wish it did not come to this. I wish there was something we could have done.~
@5098 = ~They were arrogant through and through, and their plan was monstrous. I do not feel any remorse.~
@5099 = ~I feel resentment. I think you are at least partly guilty.~
@5100 = ~I am not well, but there are other reasons, as you well know.~
@5101 = ~(sigh) You are in your element, as always. Perhaps this is just as well: I was worried about you.~
@5102 = ~I am not accusing you. I was worried about you.~
@5103 = ~As do I. I am glad to hear this from you.~
@5104 = ~Logical enough, I suppose. But we could avoid it, couldn't we... or could we?~
@5105 = ~I am, yes. But if there was a single chance to make them change their minds, I had to use it. And I could not participate in what they offered, <CHARNAME>, never; I could not.~
@5106 = ~Of course; and I'd visit a healer, too, though, as you well know, this is ultimately pointless.~
@5107 = ~Eldreth Veluuthra... I am to protect my people, all my people... but at what cost? And if there is some absolute right, who possesses it?  Perhaps the Council will know; I shall alert them in any case, but...~
@5108 = ~(sigh) I don't know. Some say 'genocide', but they do not do it out of malice; they believe they are right, and in some cases, where the humans' intent is thoroughly barbaric, they are. And yet I am to fight our own brethren, if I am to remain the defender of the others. What am I to do?~
@5109 = ~No, do not answer: I think I shall collapse if I think about it for much longer. Let... let us go.~
@5110 = ~Aegnor's Offer.

We met an elven rogue, Aegnor, in the slums. He mentioned that something "terrible and wondrous for the elven race" should happen soon, and asked Xan to meet him at night near the entrance to the Government District, to introduce him to his superiors.~
@5111 = ~Aegnor's Offer.

Aegnor's superiors were revealted to be a part of Eldreth Veluuthra, an evil elven organization, which goal is eradicating all humankind on Faerun. They were planning to poison the city guard, temples and Council. Xan, however, was against that task, and the meeting ended in violence.~
@5112 = ~Aegnor's Offer.

Aegnor's superiors were revealted to be a part of Eldreth Veluuthra, an evil elven organization, which goal is eradicating all humankind on Faerun. They were planning to poison the city guard, temples and Council. Xan, however, was against that task, and they let us go, warning us that they will attack, if we betray their plan to the authorities.~
@5113 = ~Aegnor's Offer.

We approached Chief Inspector Brega, and told him about the plan. He thanked us for the information, but the subsequent investigation revealed nothing else.~
@5114 = ~Aegnor's Offer.

Aegnor and his companions ambushed us, as we rested. Now they are dead, and we can safely report that agents of Eldreth Veluuthra no longer threaten Athkatla.~
@5115 = ~Aegnor's Offer.

Inspector Brega was glad to hear that we have been able to prevent such an evil act, and rewarded us with one thousand gold pieces.~
@5116 = ~I have discovered that agents of Eldreth Veluuthra wish to poison the city guard, temples and government.~
@5117 = ~Any news about Eldreth Veluuthra?~
@5118 = ~I came to tell you that agents of Eldreth Veluuthra, who wished to poison the water supply in Athkatla, are now dead, slain by my hand.~
@5119 = ~What? What are you talking about?~
@5120 = ~Eldreth Veluuthra, you say? I have a report about them right here... wait...~
@5121 = ~... yes, it may be true. I will check your story, but in the meantime, if you find out anything else, come to me at once.~
@5122 = ~No, there haven't been any more sightings. We are looking for them. There is a reward for their heads now, so it might be in your best interests to help, too.~
@5123 = ~That so? Well, you do not lie, I see.~
@5124 = ~There were rumors about their activity lately, and even the Cowled Wizards grew worried.~
@5125 = ~But you put an end to this. I am about to send messengers to Luskan and Baldur's Gate, so that they are forewarned, too. You've done very well, citizen.~
@5126 = ~I want to talk to you about the night I spent with Gaelan Bayle.~
@5127 = ~Xan, I have a confession to make. I've had an affair.~
@5128 = ~Don't. You did what you have to.~
@5129 = ~He wouldn't provide me with any discounts, you know.~
@5130 = ~Yes, but I also enjoyed it. Rather.~
@5131 = ~All right. I am sorry.~
@5132 = ~Coo!~
@5133 = ~I should think so.~
@5134 = ~(sigh) <CHARNAME>... must you?~
@5135 = ~He hurt you, didn't he?~
@5136 = ~Not really, he didn't. But I hoped to get his help in return.~
@5137 = ~I hoped I wouldn't have to pay this much. But I was wrong.~
@5138 = ~I feel bad about all this.~
@5139 = ~Yes, he did.~
@5140 = ~I am fine. I already feel better, somehow.~
@5141 = ~Gaelan Bayle... Can a man be such an idiot?~
@5142 = ~I don't suppose I should say words of comfort at the moment... so if I just hold you for a little while? Will it help?~
@5143 = ~Yes, please. I feel better already.~
@5144 = ~No, but thanks for the offer. It made me smile.~
@5145 = ~I think it might. Thank you.~
@5146 = ~No, there's no need.~
@5147 = ~All for talking to me? Well, thank you... I suppose. And I feel pleased now, for some strange reason. (sigh) We are a strange pair, aren't we?~
@5148 = ~You've had... ?~
@5149 = ~Yes.~
@5150 = ~Some of it still lingers on in my memory, but - in the past, yes.~
@5151 = ~Please, forget this. I just said this to see your reaction.~
@5152 = ~(sigh) I am lost for words. Excuse me, I have to... read my spellbook.~
@5153 = ~(sigh) I thank you for your honesty, but a part of me wishes you never told me this. Cowardice, I suppose. It is always better to know.~
@5154 = ~Do you love me?~
@5155 = ~I love you.~
@5156 = ~I don't know.~
@5157 = ~No.~
@5158 = ~What am I to say? I shall not disturb you again.~
@5159 = ~So do I... then all is well.~
@5160 = ~And, unlike you, I do know, when it comes to myself... is this a blessing or a curse? (sigh) Somehow, today I suspect the latter.~
@5161 = ~But our bond tells me 'yes'... what am I to think?~
@5162 = ~We'll get through... I hope. In any case, our future is too short to begin questioning the past.~
@5163 = ~I have no revelations of similar nature to make, but I do not love you any less. In fact... not the affair itself, but that you have told me - I admire you for this. I hope you can breathe easier now... or can you?~
@5164 = ~I think I can. Thanks, I guess.~
@5165 = ~No, not at all.~
@5166 = ~There is hardly any difference.~
@5167 = ~I feel rather ashamed now, to tell you the truth.~
@5168 = ~Yes, this is a relief. At first, I thought I made a mistake.~
@5169 = ~Yes, well... let us go.~
@5170 = ~You are an elf, and you are very young. And I am too afraid to lose you.~
@5171 = ~Xan, about Phaere's pleasure slave...~
@5172 = ~(sigh) I'd wreak this wretched city, if I could, just so you were never forced to... to consider such vile, disgusting things again. But I cannot.~
@5173 = ~These horrors will be over soon. Either we shall die, or we shall see the sun again. Most likely the former.~
@5174 = ~But we must go on, while we can. Come, let us try... perhaps we will forget this nightmare, in time. Please.~
@5175 = ~What do you think of revenge, <CHARNAME>? Roslin is trying to avenge his wife. Do you think he is in the right?~ [O#XAN000]
@5176 = ~He is helping me, and that's what matters.~
@5177 = ~I would do the same, if I lost someone dear to me.~
@5178 = ~No, he is not. He will regret his actions yet.~
@5179 = ~Do you?~
@5180 = ~I don't know if I approve, but I can understand him. If you or someone else from our party was lost... our enemies would pay. Dearly.~
@5181 = ~But going against his own superiors? Putting his own mentor's life in danger? Planning a ritual involving relics of the Creator Races? Just how far is Roslin willing to go?~
@5182 = ~I do not know. Perhaps he believes his life is not important anymore.~
@5183 = ~When I lost Gorion, I was ready to do the same.~
@5184 = ~When Imoen was taken from me, I was ready to go any lengths to save her.~
@5185 = ~When I was pursuing Irenicus, I behaved in the same manner.~
@5186 = ~Maybe it's not about his wife. Maybe he thinks he can get what he wants by lying to me.~
@5187 = ~The ends justify the means? (sigh) Maybe... but what will Roslin get in return? What will you get in return?~
@5188 = ~I am worried. You are... but you know what you are, <CHARNAME>. I need not remind you of being careful.~
@5189 = ~Of course. I am careful, Xan.~
@5190 = ~I trust Roslin. I think everything will be all right.~
@5191 = ~I am dying, Xan. I do not have a choice.~
@5192 = ~I know. I know. You won't lose your head. (sigh) At least I hope so.~
@5193 = ~The sea again. Beautiful, blue, shining... (sigh) And here we are, killing people.~ [O#XAN311]
@5194 = ~Just doing my job. Or fulfilling my destiny, whatever strikes your fancy.~
@5195 = ~Your point being?..~
@5196 = ~It's hopeless. I know. Give it a rest, Xan.~
@5197 = ~I love the sea. I wish we could spend a few hours just sitting and watching it.~
@5198 = ~Oh - I was not talking of your heritage or blood on our hands; I am sorry if it came out wrong - and it did, didn't it. No, I was just thinking of the sea, of the Sword Coast, of old times...~
@5199 = ~Evereska is far from the sea. When I got to the Sword Coast for the very first time, I was blinded by that sky-colored vastness; I've gone deaf.~
@5200 = ~And now this feeling returns again. Do you remember your days on the Sword Coast, <CHARNAME>? It was dangerous, but the beauty of the white sand, wet rocks and the wind - do you recall?~
@5201 = ~I remember it all, Xan. I am glad you do, too.~
@5202 = ~And sirines. I remember their poisoned arrows especially well.~
@5203 = ~Are you nostalgic?~
@5204 = ~(shudder) Oh, yes. My shoulder, too, still remembers.~
@5205 = ~In a way, yes. I miss uncomplicated times. Not often, though: I don't have the luxury.~
@5206 = ~When we are gone, the sea will still be here. It will remember us... remember me. Remember me, <CHARNAME>, when I'm gone, will you? If there's something lasting in this world, it's the memory of the gods.~
@5207 = ~I am dying, Xan. How can I promise something like that?~
@5208 = ~My memory may not be as lasting as you think.~
@5209 = ~The sea is calling, check, our enemies are dead, check, and Xan is talking about death, check. Everything seems to be fine.~
@5210 = ~You may yet survive. Nothing is lost: while Irenicus lives, your soul endures.~
@5211 = ~But me? (sigh) I see the sea, it is beautiful... but when I think of my future, I see only death. Whose? I do not know.~
@5212 = ~<CHARNAME>, you are killing people.~ [O#XAN000]
@5213 = ~I am a Bhaalspawn. We do that.~
@5214 = ~Which people?~
@5215 = ~Are you talking about Lynn's missions?~
@5216 = ~I am an assassin. Yes.~
@5217 = ~Why?~
@5218 = ~What are you talking about?~
@5219 = ~Because! End of discussion.~
@5220 = ~You *are* talking about Lynn, right? Well, I have my reasons.~
@5221 = ~Gathering money, earning reputation, relieving my thirst for murder. Satisfied?~
@5222 = ~It is my job, Xan. I love it just like you love magic.~
@5223 = ~I don't have a choice.~
@5224 = ~(Xan looks at you in silence.)~
@5225 = ~Let us end this conversation.~
@5226 = ~I am sorry, Xan. I cannot tell you anything else.~
@5227 = ~Do you want me to put an end to this? I will.~
@5228 = ~If you are trying to tell me something, say it now. I tire of these games.~
@5229 = ~(Xan looks at you for a few moments, then turns away.)~
@5230 = ~Trapped again. Just like I thought.~ [O#XAN000]
@5231 = ~We'll get out yet. Concentrate, I will need your magic.~
@5232 = ~Forget about it! Look, treasure!~
@5233 = ~Xan, please keep quiet.~
@5234 = ~What difference will it make?~
@5235 = ~(sigh) <CHARNAME>, didn't you hear a word I was saying? These beasts inside are more powerful than anything I've seen before. We are doomed.~
@5236 = ~Uh-huh. I hear you. Now, will you carry these potions for me?~
@5237 = ~Haven't you prepared your spells? Relax, we'll be fine.~
@5238 = ~I realize we are in danger. What do you propose?~
@5239 = ~I think that's enough, Xan. Please, stop.~
@5240 = ~(sigh) Not getting inside would have been good for a start.~
@5241 = ~<CHARNAME>, I - I'm sorry to distract you right now, but since we *are* about do die, I must.~
@5242 = ~I...~
@5243 = ~What is it, Xan?~
@5244 = ~It is all right. Just tell me.~
@5245 = ~If you are afraid, I understand. It is a dreary place.~
@5246 = ~(sigh) I am scared to die. I am scared witless. Even though I have more than a few powerful spells at my disposal, it does not matter: I sense we will die tonight, and my fingers are shaking.~
@5247 = ~<CHARNAME>, please... For me, for you, for others - let us rest now. Let us prepare a little more. I know we are ready, I believe in your ability - but give me a few hours. Please.~
@5248 = ~I understand, Xan. You will have them.~
@5249 = ~All right. We shall rest now.~
@5250 = ~I am sorry, Xan. I cannot give you what you want.~
@5251 = ~No, and do not ask me again.~
@5252 = ~Thank you.~
@5253 = ~(sigh) I'm lucky I am still alive, I suppose.~
@5254 = ~That... was quite a colorful adventure.~ [O#XAN000]
@5255 = ~And I am glad we got out alive.~
@5256 = ~It was beautiful.~
@5257 = ~Heheh. I noticed the pun.~
@5258 = ~It was a terrifying experience. But there was beauty, too, of a sort. A strange world underground, locked on itself. And you were needed there, <CHARNAME>.~
@5259 = ~I admit that I found Touch's attention to be a little too... sudden and otherworldly, but he seemed so genuinely distraught at your parting that I do not have the heart to blame him. You are unique, after all.~
@5260 = ~What do you feel? Now that you are free again, how will you remember the place?~
@5261 = ~Fondly. Touch fell in love with me, after all.~
@5262 = ~I would like to return there some day. But, yes, I will remember.~
@5263 = ~I try not to. I am well out of it.~
@5264 = ~My thoughts exactly. And yet...~
@5265 = ~I will remember people on the streets the best. Men and women... strange, slow, colorless... oh, but now I speak in their manner. I shouldn't. But they fascinated me.~
@5266 = ~They longed for color. And now you gathered it and gave it to them. You saved a small world yet again.~
@5267 = ~It... it means much to me, <CHARNAME>. That you are saving worlds, not destroying them.~
@5268 = ~Maybe I haven't had the opportunity yet.~
@5269 = ~It means a lot to me, too. Especially given my heritage.~
@5270 = ~I just wanted to get out of there.~
@5271 = ~(sigh) Something tells me you will, and soon. But let us not talk of this.~
@5272 = ~Perhaps that's the reason why you plunge headfirst into every adventure, then? Proving yourself to you, me, Gorion... But I cannot judge your motives; forgive me.~
@5273 = ~(sigh) So did I, believe me. But you made the right choice every time. I know how hard it was, and I admire you for it. My own head felt like it was going to burst.~
@5274 = ~When the wizard cast Imprisonment and winked at me, I thought my heart would stop. When the earth was yanked from under my feet and I realized I was following you, it was almost a relief. After all, a certain death is preferable to an uncertain one.~
@5275 = ~And later, in the Deep Gardens... I lost all knowledge. I lost faith. My magic was with me, but it meant nothing. All that was left was surprise and wonder.~
@5276 = ~But I am glad we are alive. Glad we are under the clear skies again. And I... thank you.~
@5277 = ~You are welcome, Xan.~
@5278 = ~Let us just continue on.~
@5279 = ~Let us go, then. And...~
@5280 = ~(Xan looks at the amber rose in your hand and gives you a slight smile.)~
@5281 = ~It was a good adventure.~
@5282 = ~Xan, your lover and your friend, is ever by your side. He looks at the stairs with a grim look on his face, but when he straightens, you see only warmth in his eyes.~
@5283 = ~I am with you, Estel'amin. Until the end.~
@5284 = ~Come. Let us forge our legend and return your soul.~
@5285 = ~I am sorry, Estel'amin. This was unworthy of me. I... I just need a minute. Or maybe an hour. Do not mind me.~
@5286 = ~Back in Baldur's Gate, I had a dream about your death. In a crypt. Surrounded by vampires.~
@5287 = ~Your moonblade may kill you if it deems your actions unjust, but you are just following my orders.~
@5288 = ~When I think about how you could've died in the graveyard...~
@5289 = ~I am disappointed your mate survived. But his turn will come! You will all suffer!~
@5290 = ~(Xan draws his sword, and as brilliant flames dance around his pale face, you suddenly understand what is about to happen. He will direct the power of the sword at himself and die, as he told you he would.)~
@5291 = ~(Gather your willpower and stop the blade.)~
@5292 = ~(Try with all your might to draw the pain away from him.)~
@5293 = ~(Concentrate on the sword through your link, forbidding him to touch Xan.)~
@5294 = ~(Do nothing.)~
@5295 = ~(The force of the blow hurls you to your knees, but you are alive. Yet something whispers that the worst is yet to come. The moonblade's strike is coming. You will save Xan, but the pain might kill you.)~
@5296 = ~(The decision is made. You will save Xan, no matter the cost.)~
@5297 = ~(Leave the blade alone and let Xan proceed.)~
@5298 = ~(Xan pales and cries out, his grip on the blade's hilt less steady.) Ithilmegil, tua amin!~
@5299 = ~(You are both flung on the ground, hurting everywhere, although your body appears undamaged. Judging from your bond, Xan is marginally worse off, but by no means near death.)~ [O#XAN000]
@5300 = ~(You are alive, both of you. You are alive. You won.)~
@5301 = ~You... you burned your spirits so they wouldn't survive the transformation, didn't you? Well, no matter. I have other tricks.~
@5302 = ~(Xan suddenly stops you; he has a look of uncertainty on his face.)~ [O#XAN000]
@5303 = ~<CHARNAME>, there is something I wanted to tell you.~ [O#XAN279]
@5304 = ~Do you remember the dream you had, back in Baldur's Gate? Not the ones about your divine father. The dream about my body lying in a crypt of blue and orange, surrounded by vampires?~
@5305 = ~Your pale and slender body, if you please. Pay attention to details.~
@5306 = ~I wish I didn't, but I remember it, yes.~
@5307 = ~Not really. Wait, you died, you say?~
@5308 = ~What of it?~
@5309 = ~I don't remember telling you about it. Do I talk in my sleep?~
@5310 = ~(sigh) I can tell an old joke about a pale, slender elf who twisted a slender ring on his pale, slender finger, summoned a fireball and turned into a pale, slender pile of ash, if you prefer.~
@5311 = ~You just did.~
@5312 = ~You don't say. Was it a pale, slender fireball?~
@5313 = ~Yes, well... we can talk of simple, light and domestic things later. My latest dream, however, foretold that there would be no 'later'.~
@5314 = ~So, not that I want to, but let us return to the subject of the rather unlovely vision I had.~
@5315 = ~Melamin, we talked through the night, shared reveries, dreamt together and felt each other through our bond. But listen: the vision did not visit you alone.~
@5316 = ~I had your dream, <CHARNAME>. Your very dream about the crypt and vampires, although I was seeing it from a rather uncomfortable position: the cold hard floor. (sigh) I never imagined the budding undead get cricks in their necks, either...~
@5317 = ~In my dream, I was still an elf, but becoming less and less so with each passing second. A dark disease for which I can find no name was filling me. It was not true undeath, not even a pale shadow - the vision was merciful, so I felt nearly nothing. But... it was a warning.~
@5318 = ~You think you are going to die? Again? AGAIN? I think I'm going to break into Ao's sanctuary and give those Tablets of Fate a good rewriting.~
@5319 = ~Forewarned means forearmed. We need more holy water, some meat shields... I mean, allies at our back, and a few nice protection scrolls for good measure.~
@5320 = ~This can be a true vision. But I will save you, Xan, I swear it.~
@5321 = ~I think I remember seeing parts of it through our bond. It was horrible.~
@5322 = ~What can we do?~
@5323 = ~<CHARNAME>... while you are incredible in your righteous - or wrongeous - rage, I still think you should listen.~
@5324 = ~I consider undeath worse than any mortal injury. You know this. If something like this happens... I would never take my own life directly, but if my moonblade will do it for me, I will accept its gift without question.~
@5325 = ~You have the power to touch my blade, to draw the pain away - to you. But if you do this, you may die, fade into nothingness, while I will pass to Arvandor.~
@5326 = ~Do not do this, <CHARNAME>: not until a similar fate to Bodhi's threatens you, and perhaps not even then. Please.~
@5327 = ~Xan, you may repeat this another thousand times, but you still won't change my mind.~
@5328 = ~What if I could save you from this fate? Would you believe in me?~
@5329 = ~I hear you.~
@5330 = ~I never doubt you - not in these strange days. But if my dream speaks true, you will simply be too late.~
@5331 = ~I know you have your own mind, and a brilliant one it is. You are the Hero of Baldur's Gate, my partner, my heroine. But the Fates are not written by us. Sometimes... we are helpless.~
@5332 = ~(He turns away and speaks very quietly.) And yet, I have hope.~
@5333 = ~I will die, <CHARNAME>. It is as simple and plain as the stars in the sky, and just as hopeless.~
@5334 = ~It is not. There is hope, or we wouldn't be talking about this.~
@5335 = ~I do not want to believe it. We can do something to prevent it, can we?~
@5336 = ~All right, I'll bite. You are DOOMED, and your DOOM increases exponentially with every second. And there is no escape. Alas! Woe, woe! I think I'll restrain from pulling my hair, though.~
@5337 = ~You may be right.~
@5338 = ~(sigh) <CHARNAME>, there is always hope. There is always a chance, or there was, as tired adventurers tell each other over their friends' dead bodies. If only they'd been a little stronger... a little faster... checked that trap... looked over a corner.~
@5339 = ~But it does not work with us. When a grand story is unraveling, all visions come to fruition, and there is no way around that. None. The gods have seen to that.~
@5340 = ~I will not accept it. I will trick the gods, if I have to.~
@5341 = ~You are too pessimistic, Xan. I will fight tooth and nail for you. Fight with me.~
@5342 = ~Tell me what I should do to save you. If it means I must die instead, I will.~
@5343 = ~No. Look at me. I am your bond mate, Xan. I am dead without you.~
@5344 = ~So be it, then. I am tired of fighting.~
@5345 = ~I am sorry, Xan. I do not think we can do anything about it.~
@5346 = ~(sigh) I would fight, but I do not know who, or how. And even if I did...~
@5347 = ~(He turns away and speaks very quietly.) I know there is no hope.~
@5348 = ~I... <CHARNAME>, do you mean that?~
@5349 = ~Was there ever any doubt?~
@5350 = ~Don't you feel it through our bond?~
@5351 = ~Of course I do. I love you.~
@5352 = ~I don't know. Perhaps not.~
@5353 = ~Then... Seldarine forgive my cowardice... (Xan sighs deeply.)~
@5354 = ~Touch my blade, <CHARNAME>. It is safe for you, but do not attempt to draw it.~
@5355 = ~Very well.~
@5356 = ~You explained it to me once - I will be able to draw the pain from you, should the blade strike you, right?~
@5357 = ~All right, here I come...~
@5358 = ~No, I changed my mind, Xan. I am sorry.~
@5359 = ~Just so. Yet it will never severely harm you, if I do not wish it - and I never will.~
@5360 = ~Then... then perhaps it is for the best.~
@5361 = ~(Your fingers glide over the cool surface of the sword, and suddenly a whirlwind of emotions flashes through your mind - but of what passes between you and Xan's moonblade, you can never remember after.)~
@5362 = ~You will decide when the time comes. I will just say that the blade will listen to your will now - although it may not comply.~
@5363 = ~And... since it knows my heart, it may not want to, since I hold your life in high sanctity, far above my own. But it will let you decide.~
@5364 = ~And this is it?~
@5365 = ~Well, thank the Seldarine for small mercies.~
@5366 = ~Then you will live, melamin. And we will have a happy ending.~
@5367 = ~We can only hope. But I have a premonition that it is up to you now.~
@5368 = ~(Xan rises from the ground, breathing soundlessly, but with visible effort.)~ [O#XAN000]
@5369 = ~What... what happened? <CHARNAME>, did you... did you influence the moonblade?~ [O#XAN280]
@5370 = ~What do you think?~
@5371 = ~You have three guesses.~
@5372 = ~So I did! It was easier than I thought, anyhow.~
@5373 = ~It just happened. I didn't do anything.~
@5374 = ~I think I can take a good guess. Oh... Seldarine, is this finally over?~ [O#XAN301]
@5375 = ~The nasty business with vampires and undeath and visions and evading death? I think it's just beginning.~
@5376 = ~Ha! It's NEVER over.~
@5377 = ~It is over. We beat that damned vision. Just be careful in the crypt.~
@5378 = ~No word of thanks for your beautiful savior?~
@5379 = ~True. But let us forget about it for a minute. Let me look at you.~
@5380 = ~I intend to be. And the same goes for you. I would hate to lose you after all this.~
@5381 = ~Melamin, <CHARNAME>, you are the brightest star of them all. The only one.~
@5382 = ~When I had that dream about becoming an undead in Bodhi's crypts, I fully intended to die here, in the graveyard. I... I hoped against hope, but to see your sacrifice firsthand...~ [O#XAN302]
@5383 = ~Thank you. It must not stay unsaid. But how are you? Are we even ready to proceed?~ [O#XAN303]
@5384 = ~If you are all right, I am fine, Xan. Let's gut vampires.~
@5385 = ~My head is still spinning. I need a minute.~
@5386 = ~Compared to how I'd feel standing over your dead body? I feel glorious.~
@5387 = ~A little disappointed, to be truthful. After all these visions, I expected something grand.~
@5388 = ~Without question. If you need a particularly devastating and nasty spell, just say a word.~
@5389 = ~Here, lean on me. Oh, <CHARNAME>... we have a minute. We have the rest of our lives.~
@5390 = ~It is amazing. Do you feel it? We have the rest of our lives.~
@5391 = ~And instead, I simply get to live. Not very inspiring, I know.~
@5392 = ~I love you. This must not go unsaid another minute, either. And... if ever you need my life - whether to save or prolong yours, to make me a high priest of the new Lady of Murder, to use in a magic ritual or simply to plunge into the next heedless adventure - you need but ask.~ [O#XAN304]
@5393 = ~And I love you. Forever.~
@5394 = ~Just live. This is all I ask.~
@5395 = ~Haha! I'll remember it!~
@5396 = ~(wink) I would never ask you these things, dear. The choice is always your own.~
@5397 = ~A high priest, a willing sacrifice - my, that's grounds for some serious role-playing.~
@5398 = ~(sigh) Sometimes you are so enchantingly evil I'm tempted to become a daredevil rascal myself... not that I have it in me. But it is time, melamin. Let us go.~
@5399 = ~Perhaps when we are back from the crypts? I'll wager every truly exciting adventure starts with a spectacular hot bath... with a thorough massage thrown in.~
@5400 = ~You are enchanting me.~
@5401 = ~I'm in!~
@5402 = ~Mmm!~
@5403 = ~Let's speak of it when we are back.~
@5404 = ~Always.~
@5405 = ~We will be back, Estel'amin. You gave me hope, and I will not be the one to lose it.~
@5406 = ~(Xan wipes his forehead. Perspiration is visible on his cheekbones, although it is cold in the crypts.)~ [O#XAN000]
@5407 = ~The deed is done, it seems. I'd bury another dozen of stakes in her coffin for good measure, but that'd be a waste of wood. Especially since stakes are so hard to find around the city.~ [O#XAN281]
@5408 = ~Kind of ironic, isn't it? A coven of vampires in the city, and not a single merchant sells simple stakes and holy water. We get them from Elhan, of all people.~
@5409 = ~He probably wanted to charge us, too.~
@5410 = ~Xan, you are babbling.~
@5411 = ~Oh, who cares! Bodhi is dead! Woo-hoo! We're celebrating tonight!~
@5412 = ~Are you all right? What happened at the graveyard couldn't have been easy.~
@5413 = ~She was an elf, too. Amazing.~
@5414 = ~And he would, trust me. The man must have worked in a pawnshop.~
@5415 = ~What? Ah, yes. I... need some time to adjust to the news, though.~
@5416 = ~I had my doubts, but even in my darkest dream I did not imagine Bodhi had a spirit, and her brother stole a spirit from a fellow elf. Compared to this, even our brushes with death pale.~
@5417 = ~How so?~
@5418 = ~I'd think dying triumphs everything.~
@5419 = ~I could not believe Bodhi was an elf, either. Ugh.~
@5420 = ~Really? It was obvious to me.~
@5421 = ~I have always been strangely fascinated by Irenicus. I suppose it makes sense he's an elf.~
@5422 = ~'Ugh' indeed. And the lady wanted to ensnare me into her esteemed company. Can you imagine the horror?~
@5423 = ~Not to me, however. I suppose I was too reluctant to look.~
@5424 = ~He has your spirit, melamin. Your fascination is more than understandable: you are two sides of the same coin, for the moment.~
@5425 = ~Come to think of it, here's an unpleasant thought: by holding your spirit, he knows you better than nearly anyone else. I... do not relish dwelling on it. ~
@5426 = ~(sigh) And yet...~
@5427 = ~I am a Defender of Elvendom, if you recall. Corellon is harsh, but in some matters he... advocates mercy. Redemption. A longer road, if you will.~
@5428 = ~Have I made a mistake, then? Was there redemption for Bodhi? For Irenicus? For... the Underdark, for that matter? If Irenicus cared about his sister, if Bodhi watched out for her brother, does it mean they were not devoid of empathy? That even Phaere and her wicked mother could've been saved?~
@5429 = ~Maybe. But were we given a chance? Nope. So, not your fault.~
@5430 = ~Hey, how about good old "protect innocents, slay evil"? Works for me.~
@5431 = ~No way! If we start redeeming vampires and liches, where will we get the loot?~
@5432 = ~And yet they died. I regret it, too.~
@5433 = ~So, you'd redeem other elves, but not humans or dwarves? That's a bit racist.~
@5434 = ~(Xan smiles.) If only looting were the highest of Corellon's priorities, we'd have long become one of his favored.~
@5435 = ~Of course it is, and always was. We are heroes in our minds, <CHARNAME>, and rarely see the whole picture. But even if we paint a tiny bit with a warmer color, isn't it better than total darkness?~
@5436 = ~I hate your metaphors.~
@5437 = ~I guess so.~
@5438 = ~Still, this superiority galls me.~
@5439 = ~We cannot change the fabric of reality, melamin. Even if you took your father's throne, you'd have to play by the rules.~
@5440 = ~Perhaps if we are ever free of Alaundo's prophecies, then... (sigh) Still, my moonblade would remain, so I must do what I must.~
@5442 = ~Neither my blade nor Corellon would not wish the impossible of me, I know. So this regret is likely my own indecision. Still... it lingers.~
@5443 = ~(Xan breathes deeply and turns to you.)~ [O#XAN000]
@5444 = ~At last, the River of the Shining Wind! We are in the city of High Magic, melamin, do you hear this?~ [O#XAN282]
@5445 = ~Loud and clear. Fireballs on the streets kinda give it away.~
@5446 = ~I thought you'd be more focused on the bodies.~
@5447 = ~It is incredible. And inspiring. I only regret we are here at the time of war.~
@5448 = ~Not really. I am not much for poetry.~
@5449 = ~I do. It is ringing in the air.~
@5450 = ~In every syllable. Sul-da-nesse - the wind itself shines by her bed.~
@5451 = ~We really should stop talking and help the elves, Xan.~
@5452 = ~I swam in this river once, many years ago. I only remember now; isn't it strange? And now the streets where I walked as a young acolyte are tainted by death. And yet the waters carry their song as ever.~
@5453 = ~Isn't reality strange, <CHARNAME>? Or is it just me? Narrowly saved from death and undeath, and admiring every single thing?~
@5454 = ~I cannot blame you. You almost died.~
@5455 = ~I don't know. Maybe both?~
@5456 = ~Irenicus will die, I will regain my spirit, and we will walk through the city together, arm in arm, laughing.~
@5457 = ~There will be much rejoicing when peace comes. And much sorrow.~
@5458 = ~I... I am sorry, melamin, we probably should go. With each moment we hesitate here, another life is taken, and you are missing your spirit. I will not let my foolish ruminations delay us.~
@5459 = ~And here I thought my day couldn't get any better.~ [O#XAN283]
@5460 = ~You mean worse?~
@5461 = ~Our day, you mean.~
@5462 = ~Took it straight from my mouth.~
@5463 = ~A pleasant place, isn't it? You were saying?~
@5464 = ~I'm not sure what I mean anymore, these days. Sometimes my mouth just opens, and... (sigh)~
@5465 = ~Unfortunately, my dizziness passes, yet our surroundings do not change. Not a dream, then.~
@5466 = ~Well, we are doomed.~
@5467 = ~This is Xan we all know and love!~
@5468 = ~Let us lie down and die.~
@5469 = ~We are getting out of here. Just keep out an eye for the Big Bad.~
@5470 = ~I hate to say it, but I kind of agree. No stairs, no portal, and five suspicious holes. "Doomed" is more than appropriate here.~
@5471 = ~Much as I appreciate your good humor... wait, actually, I do appreciate it. How strange. The place suddenly became a little less dismal. We should repeat it some time.~
@5472 = ~Since we are in the Abyss, does it mean you are evil, I wonder? That we all are?~
@5473 = ~No, it makes no sense. We are here because of Irenicus, of course. But evil... evil is in the air. You'll be tempted, most likely.~
@5474 = ~(grin) I already AM evil. You should know that, Xan.~
@5475 = ~Why do you think that?~
@5476 = ~You'll warn me to stay strong, I suppose?~
@5477 = ~Nah, I'll pass. I am not a paragon of goodness, but some things I just do not do.~
@5478 = ~Maybe. We'll have to explore this realm to find out more.~
@5479 = ~(Xan smiles slightly and takes you by the hand.) I think that I do.~
@5480 = ~This is not my choice, <CHARNAME>. You know yourself best.~
@5481 = ~As a mage, sometimes I watched demon summoning ceremonies in Evereska. It was tightly controlled, of course, and happened only because of the highest need, although my heart still thought it unnecessary.~
@5482 = ~Some demons were talkative. They offered power, insight, invulnerability to weapons... I could become a High Mage simply by turning my back on all that was good and right, it seemed.~
@5483 = ~(Xan is silent for a long time.) One even offered to free me of my moonblade.~
@5484 = ~But you obviously did not take the deal.~
@5485 = ~What happened?~
@5486 = ~And you didn't accept?!~
@5487 = ~I almost said "no", then I strongly felt like saying "yes". Then... well, while I hesitated, the demon disappeared. Fortunately, without harming anyone.~
@5488 = ~And I cannot say I never regretted it. Do what you will, my love. I will not think of you less.~
@5489 = ~Just... be alive. I need you. We all do, in this dreary place.~
@5490 = ~I think you told me about this before. Was that the only time you'd had the nightmare?~
@5491 = ~I think so. It was more like a vision, really. A crypt, vampires, your body lying there...~
@5492 = ~It repeated itself after that, but not as vividly. Blue and orange weren't as bluish and orang-y.~
@5493 = ~Once was enough, thank you very much.~
@5494 = ~I don't remember talking about it before, but yes, only once.~
@5495 = ~You must have seen it through our bond.~
@5496 = ~Strange. I had a gift for visions in my early youth, but it vanished within years - or months, rather. But this is something else: you are a child of a god, after all.~
@5497 = ~And I was indeed sent here to investigate vampires...~
@5498 = ~I do not have consoling words for you, <CHARNAME>. I don't even have them for myself, truth be told. If that old dream of yours is true, I am doomed. More than that... oh, Corellon...~
@5499 = ~If my fate is indeed to be doomed with the undead, it may mean more than death. It may mean undeath, becoming the same as them - and I would rather my moonblade killed me.~
@5500 = ~It is... a horrible prospect. Both of these choices are. But between being trapped in my blade and becoming a hated, dead thing, I choose the former without hesitation.~
@5501 = ~You do? What about me? We are bonded, Xan, remember?~
@5502 = ~I won't let you surrender that easily!~
@5503 = ~I understand. It would be the right thing to do.~
@5504 = ~Oh, please, Xan, it is just a dream. I am sure nothing will happen.~
@5505 = ~Be it as it may, it is important to me.~
@5506 = ~I am not giving up, melamin. I will fight to my last breath, and we Defenders of Elvendom are not as easily beaten, strange as it sounds to my own ears. But should the inevitable - or so it seems - occur, I will be ready. And I want you to be ready, too.~
@5507 = ~Oh, I will be ready. These vampires will BURN.~
@5508 = ~I am always ready, my love.~
@5509 = ~Do not do this, Xan. Please.~
@5510 = ~This is a mistake. Probably the greatest you'll ever make.~
@5511 = ~I will not take the final step, until I must. This much I can promise you. And perhaps... perhaps the worst will yet pass us by. Who knows?~
@5512 = ~And, doomed or not, I stand ready to assist, Estel'amin. Always.~
@5513 = ~More than that, I can even take you with me. If my fate is indeed to be doomed with the undead, I would rather be killed by my moonblade - and since you have touched it and can draw away the pain, the blade might well kill you, too. Oh, Corellon, what have I done?~
@5514 = ~We are doomed. No question.~
@5515 = ~How about "we have a chance to live!" instead? Now I have a chance of protecting you from your moonblade, at least.~
@5516 = ~Oh, gods.~
@5517 = ~Right. I'm off to buy some stakes.~
@5518 = ~(Cry quietly.)~
@5519 = ~But not from the undead, <CHARNAME>. You cannot protect me during every moment of every battle, and neither would I want you to. No, we should just accept things as they come. Moreover, I would like you to promise me one thing.~
@5520 = ~Your sarcasm notwithstanding, I require something of you. A vow, if you will.~
@5521 = ~Should your dream prove true, should the undead overwhelm me, I shall call on my moonblade to save myself. It will kill me, trap me in its core, yes, but I will not become one of... them.~
@5522 = ~But you have touched my moonblade. You can take the pain into yourself, 'save' me from dying. Do not do this. Please. Promise me, make a vow - or not, but do not do this. If worst comes to worst, let me die.~
@5523 = ~What? No! Never!~
@5524 = ~I promise, Xan. I will shed a tear, wave you goodbye with a pretty lace handkerchief, and do absolutely nothing to save you. Uh-huh. Solemn vow.~
@5525 = ~I myself would rather die than become a vampire. I... understand, Xan.~
@5526 = ~I know you are right, but I cannot lose you.~
@5527 = ~I am sorry, Xan. I simply do not know.~
@5528 = ~All right. I do so swear.~
@5529 = ~I have no right to ask something like this of you, I know this. But we all have to make choices we do not want to make.~
@5530 = ~I am a child of god. I do not "have to" do anything.~
@5531 = ~You will live, Xan. I promise you this.~
@5532 = ~I understand.~
@5533 = ~I... will think on your words.~
@5534 = ~If you think I am going to let you die, you are sorely mistaken.~
@5535 = ~And yet...~
@5536 = ~You probably guessed it yourself: the dream was true, after all. Bodhi did indeed try to snare me, and I called upon my blade to protect me, and it would've killed me... if you hadn't intervened.~
@5537 = ~So, with variations, it indeed came to pass. But here we stand, alive.~
@5538 = ~Here is hoping we avoided this doom, Estel'amin. We can, of course, find another, but this is a matter of tomorrow. (sigh) Or today. Or the next hour, come to think of it.~
@5539 = ~In any case, the dream is done. I would bury it, and in time, it will fade.~
@5540 = ~Hopefully.~
@5541 = ~I'm just happy you're alive.~
@5542 = ~Don't you dare think of some new way to die on me. I will kill you myself, I kid you not.~
@5543 = ~(Xan kisses you.) I plan to remain alive. For the next sixty seconds. Then another. Then, perhaps - if I am lucky - another. If these seconds stretch into an eternity with you, I won't complain.~
@5544 = ~But I'll be happy with the next few hundreds of years.~
@5545 = ~Indeed I do, ironic though it is. And you think this unjust?~
@5546 = ~You know my opinion. I wish there was no moonblade at all.~
@5547 = ~Actually, no. Better you than me.~
@5548 = ~Of course. If it wishes to punish someone, let it be me. I make the choices in our little party, after all.~
@5549 = ~Don't you?~
@5550 = ~This I know very well. What *was* Corellon thinking when he created them?.. I can't even imagine... But enough: it cannot be undone, and we both know it.~
@5551 = ~On that point, you and I agree, strangely enough.~
@5552 = ~Still, it bothers you, I gather?~
@5553 = ~That you're going to die or that you're going to die because of something I do? Both.~
@5554 = ~Not really. Just asked.~
@5555 = ~I don't want you to die. It is as simple as that.~
@5556 = ~(Xan looks at you very seriously.) <CHARNAME>, I am older than you, and my choices are mine. I am not saying "mine alone", for you figure most profoundly in these choices. But I make them. I follow you out of my own free will, although on that, I am not quite sure: does one need free will to breathe?~
@5557 = ~But no matter. What I mean to say is, a year ago I made a choice: to be with you, to follow you, whatever happens. And if my blade deems it wrong and strikes me down for whatever reason... well. I can die with it.~
@5558 = ~Ever the master of irony, eh, Xan?~
@5559 = ~And if I don't want you to? We are bonded: don't I have any say in that?~
@5560 = ~Can't I do anything? Anything at all?~
@5561 = ~It's just very unfair, that's all I'm saying.~
@5562 = ~So be it.~
@5563 = ~Well, then, you asked for it: I shall answer.~
@5564 = ~Yes, melamin: so be it. And with it, we shall go. Although... there is something you should know first.~
@5565 = ~You must understand, <CHARNAME>: it is quite hopeless. My life, and my death, have been predetermined since the day I became the wielder; I am doomed to my fate, just as you are, perhaps, destined to win.~
@5566 = ~Or to die a horrible death: that happens, too. Irony is about the only thing we still have, besides each other.~
@5567 = ~But there is one thing, if you want it.~
@5568 = ~I cannot share my blade with you, and I would not want you to become its wielder. But you are my bond mate, and as such, you are doomed to feel my pain through our bond, should it occur.~
@5569 = ~If you wish, and only if my pain is more than a living soul can bear, I can pass some of it to you. It sounds callous, but I am not talking about a crushing weight: more like a puncture wound. I will not dare share more with you, anyway.~
@5570 = ~Let me get this straight: if your moonblade suddenly decides to kill you, I can take some of the damage, so that you can live? Yes, please, I'll take two.~
@5571 = ~I'm in. What should I do?~
@5572 = ~Why haven't you told me of this before, you moron! Of course I'll help!~
@5573 = ~No, Xan. I am not comfortable with it.~
@5574 = ~ I am... relieved, to be honest. It is a risk, and I wouldn't want to... I couldn't bear if... never mind.~
@5575 = ~We'll consider the matter closed. Let us go, melamin.~
@5576 = ~I... <CHARNAME>, I'm touched by your gesture, but this is not all. I know of this because I am an accomplished mage now, but this hasn't been done before. At least, not that I know of.~
@5577 = ~Imagine it happens: my moonblade decides to kill me, and you step forward to shoulder the pain with me. There is no small chance that I will die, or you will die, or we will both die. Are you sure?~
@5578 = ~I am. What do I have to do?~
@5579 = ~No... I am not, but if it is your only chance, I will take it.~
@5580 = ~I don't like the word "die", but I will proceed anyway.~
@5581 = ~Not at all. But I love you, Xan. I want to do this.~
@5582 = ~I think not. I am sorry, Xan.~
@5583 = ~The deed itself is simple. Touch my sword and repeat your willingness in your mind. To establish a rapport, watch my fingers... do it like this. Do not attempt to draw the blade, remember.~
@5584 = ~(Touch the moonblade)~
@5585 = ~I... no, Xan, I cannot do this.~
@5586 = ~(You suddenly find yourself near a forest pond, looking at the rippling water. It is quiet, the light is bright and the scenery beautiful. Secure in the knowledge that no pain, fear and suffering can touch you, you enjoy the peaceful calm.)~
@5587 = ~(Suddenly the sky opens. The wind howls, and a gigantic black whirlwind appears. With it, comes a strange knowledge that Xan is somewhere inside, in great pain, and you only need to raise your hand to the whirlwind to aid him.)~
@5588 = ~(Your own discomfort is overwhelming, however, and a tiny voice in your mind whispers that this is your plane of existence, and by ignoring the whirlwind and wishing everything to be peaceful again, you can simply make it so.)~
@5589 = ~(Boldly bear the pain and stretch your arm in the direction of the whirlwind.) ~
@5590 = ~(Almost out of breath, you raise your hand to the whirlwind.) ~
@5591 = ~(Ignore the whirlwind and Xan's pain: return to peace and serenity.)~
@5592 = ~(You open your eyes with a start. Xan is looking at you with concern.)~
@5593 = ~It did not work, did it? We shouldn't try again, <CHARNAME>; I'm ever the fool for even thinking of doing it the first time.~
@5594 = ~(When you come to, you are lying in Xan's arms, your head on his shoulder.)~
@5595 = ~(His voice is very quiet.) Did it hurt?~
@5596 = ~Not especially. I'm fine now.~
@5597 = ~A bit. I had half a mind to abandon the whole thing, you know.~
@5598 = ~Nah, just a bit of visual mumbo-jumbo. Coud've at least used a Meteor Swarm with a Gate for visual effects, you know? And Flesh to Stone to boot. Irenicus at least had an impressive repertoire.~
@5599 = ~(Xan smiles, stroking your hair.) So you *are* fine, I see. (sigh) Knowing our luck, a Meteor Swarm would be just around the corner, I'll wager.~
@5600 = ~You do look fine, if a bit pale. Still, I'm ever the fool for suggesting it in the first place.~
@5601 = ~But you didn't. A Child of Bhaal they call you, and yet you have inner goodness that's overwhelming.~
@5602 = ~You risked yourself: your love is much more stronger than I deserve. I would say I am grateful - and repeat it until I am out of breath - but words are meaningless here, aren't they?~
@5603 = ~So... just know I am in awe, and always will be. Let us rest a little, and go.~
@5604 = ~Xan? Do you think anything changed? In our destinies, I mean?~
@5605 = ~Let us hope you do not die. Because now I REALLY would be pissed off.~
@5606 = ~No way. I'm staying on this shoulder, right here.~
@5607 = ~So let it be.~
@5608 = ~Who knows? Our destinies will play itself out - yours being the brightest, I should imagine. As for my own fate, I'd rather not guess. Time will tell.~
@5609 = ~Privately, I feel somewhat less doomed than usual. But I'd rather not speak and jinx it.~
@5610 = ~(quietly) So let it be.~
@5611 = ~I'd rather not think of it. When I do, there is blackness in my mind - as if I am looking somewhere I shouldn't. It is... not a pleasant feeling, Estel'amin.~
@5612 = ~Imagine if there was another Multiverse, and you died there. And kept dying again and again... until suddenly the Multiverse changed and you lived.~
@5613 = ~Really? I thought it'd be the happiest felling in the world to be alive.~
@5614 = ~I get the same feeling sometimes. Let's drop the subject.~
@5615 = ~(Xan steps up to you, encircling you in his arms.) We are together, and alive, and for once in my life I do not care for how long - I just want it to be. One day at a time, if need be.~
@5616 = ~Then I would pray to Corellon every second of my newfound days, except I hardly think he'd find that pleasing.~
@5617 = ~Do you think we'll be punished, yet? And what about our twin dreams? Was it a plot by a sinister force, perhaps? Or a benevolent deity? Cyric's doing - or Corellon's labor?~
@5618 = ~We may never know. And you know what? I'll be happier for it.~
@5619 = ~When I take my father's throne, I'll be able to deal with that "sinister force" once and for all.~
@5620 = ~Maybe if I deal with Irenicus and find a way to surrender Bhaal's essence, it will stop.~
@5621 = ~Or maybe the vision was a warning, and we heeded it.~
@5622 = ~I'll have words with Cyric, I promise you. Mad or not, he's going down.~
@5623 = ~Corellon, you say? He might well expect a visitor one of these days.~
@5624 = ~I narrowly escaped a terrible fate, thanks to you. Do not tempt the Fates further by thinking so far ahead, <CHARNAME>. Our future has a tendency of catching up with us too soon as it is.~
@5625 = ~It seems likely, come to think of it. Perhaps we'll meet a seer or a Solar one day, and she'll explain further.~
@5626 = ~Bodhi ambushed us at the graveyard and nearly killed a moonblade wielder! You sent us into a death trap, Elhan!~
@5627 = ~We all are in a death trap, <CHARNAME> - and while Irenicus roams my fair city, there will be no peace. I know how hard fear of loss strikes at the hearts of men, but do not lose courage. The battle with Bodhi was certainly not the first in your many trials.~
@5628 = ~(Xan lingers at the door for a few moments. Finally, with visible effort, he takes a step forward.)~ [O#XAN000]
@5629 = ~I do not like this place.~
@5630 = ~Big surprise.~
@5631 = ~I do not like it, either, but we must proceed.~
@5632 = ~Why? You seemed comfortable enough in the tombs before.~
@5633 = ~It's not my usual fear of immediate doom, I assure you. No, it is something else, something quite sinister...~
@5634 = ~I have seen this place before. Or have I? No, never, I am sure of it; and yet...~
@5635 = ~(sigh) Now my head hurts. <CHARNAME>, can we please conclude our share of bloodshed and betrayals here quickly and leave? I... truly, I do not feel well.~
@5636 = ~This tomb reminds me of a dream I had in Baldur's Gate. You died in that dream.~
@5637 = ~We will leave as soon as possible.~
@5638 = ~This is important, Xan. Please, you must understand.~
@5639 = ~(sigh) Even worse. And now that I am trying to recall our conversation about it, the very memory drives me even sicker. No. No, I do not wish to speak of it now.~
@5640 = ~Thank you, melamin. How I wish our journeys never led us here at all...~
@5641 = ~I understand the need. Yet my intuition - or a premonition, or a sense of danger, whatever have you - is screaming here. Let us leave, beloved. For if the doom is yours, I would never forgive myself.~
@5642 = ~You do not seem to be resting well, Xan.~
@5643 = ~Strange, isn't it? In the midst of the Underdark, be it the fabled city of Ust Natha or a comfortable beholder lair, whatever could be interrupting my peaceful reverie?~
@5644 = ~It looks like something more than that, though.~
@5645 = ~Is something bothering you? Other than the usual, I mean.~
@5646 = ~Are you having nightmares?~
@5647 = ~Yes. And no. Can we talk about it later, Veldrin? I do not want to distract you from our first priority: getting out of here.~
@5648 = ~You are never a distraction.~
@5649 = ~All right.~
@5650 = ~Yet I am now, and you are no Matron Mother, which means that we are little more than slaves, and our every step is watched.~
@5651 = ~We will talk later, I promise. When my hair turns back to brown and I see your true face, feel your hands on my arms... I will tell you then. You have too much on your mind now.~
@5652 = ~What are you reading? Is this a book on vampires?~
@5653 = ~Hmm? Indeed. Did you know that a vampire never attacks someone who wields a simple mirror? A vain girl will be as powerful as a cleric of Helm, it seems. (sigh) Of course, before someone bashes her on the head from behind and smashes the glass.~
@5654 = ~Interesting. Anything else useful?~
@5655 = ~What if she has a mirror on her back, too?~
@5656 = ~Why are you reading it? Are you preparing for an assault on their lair?~
@5657 = ~Well, she has to sleep sometime, I suppose. Or turn. Or leave her side unprotected. (sigh) In any case, the girl is doomed.~
@5658 = ~Not especially. Unless you are fond of garlic bread.~
@5659 = ~I have been given a mission to investigate the coven in Athkatla, so I am trying to be prepared, hopeless though the task is. And my last, I suspect. But something else drew my attention. You see, vampires often drain energy from powerful but unprotected adventurers - not unlike you and me, it seems. And sometimes these adventurers are turned into fledgling vampires - either seduced by a dark promise, or weakened so much they cannot resist.~
@5660 = ~To tell you the truth, I am not eager to become one of these doomed souls. Yet the book says there is nearly no defense. Abandoning my quest is not an option, since it seems to be intertwined with yours, somehow, as most things in these city are. So what should I do?~
@5661 = ~Stop worrying?~
@5662 = ~I thought we dealt with Bodhi's coven.~
@5663 = ~Protect yourself, naturally. Can a vampire get to you through several spell layers?~
@5664 = ~You? What about me? I am swarmed here, and Irenicus is far more dangerous than a vampire coven!~
@5665 = ~(sigh) Not an option, either, I am afraid.~
@5666 = ~We never destroyed Bodhi herself, you know this. Her spawn and fledglings are still around Athkatla somewhere, too. It is foolish to believe we are done for good.~
@5667 = ~(sigh) Alas, he can, if he is a master spellcaster. And I, for one, am not.~
@5668 = ~I know, <CHARNAME>. And I will aid you in this, even if it kills me. But Irenicus is just an abhorrent living being. The undead, alas, can do much worse.~
@5669 = ~One of these vampires can turn me into a fledgling. Or you. Or both of us. Or all of us, come to think of it. A fate worse than death... and a fate that comes to my mind often as of late.~
@5670 = ~I realize that my endless "becarefuls" fall on deaf ears. Still, be careful. And be alert. Some of those adventurers let their guard down - and where are they now?~
@5671 = ~Not wishing to find a female vampire next to you in the bedroll, are we?~
@5672 = ~Trust me, Xan. I am careful.~
@5673 = ~Huh? Did you say something?~
@5674 = ~We'll see.~
@5675 = ~Seldarine, no. Imagine what sort of life we'd lead: I would have to use a restoration spell after every kiss, and memorize my spells anew soon after. A dreadful amount of hassle, don't you think?~
@5676 = ~(He smiles slightly.) But I know it will never come to be. You are much stronger than this.~
@5677 = ~Sometimes I wonder what I would do, if weakened and seduced by the dark side. Call to my moonblade, fight to my last breath, plunge a dagger into my own heart or stop resisting? What should I do? What would you do? What if it happens to a friend, or someone we care about? (sigh) I can only say this: I pray we never find out.~
@5678 = ~(Xan looks very pale. He is barely standing, and a wound on the side of his head is bleeding again.)~ [O#XAN000]
@5679 = ~Xan, I cannot leave you like this. Come, we are all resting at an inn.~
@5680 = ~I'll find you some healing. You shouldn't sleep in the streets tonight.~
@5681 = ~(Go to sleep)~
@5682 = ~(As you get into your bedroll, you spy Xan lying as still as a dead man, staring into the sky with unseeing eyes. The last thing you hear before tiredness claims you is a quiet moan.)~
@5683 = ~I would... not mind, to be honest. The wound does not look serious, but my head keeps spinning. If somebody ambushes us, they will find me an easy prey.~
@5684 = ~(The room is spartanly furnished, but spacious and warm. After the healer leaves, Xan lies down on a bed with a tired sigh, but even weak as he is, he does not let go of your hand.)~ [O#XAN000]
@5685 = ~A pity the healer departed so soon.~
@5686 = ~Do you need anything?~
@5687 = ~I am here, Xan. I am not going anywhere.~
@5688 = ~Well, good night.~
@5689 = ~He left to attend to other members of our party, as I recall. They may need him more than I.~
@5690 = ~I... would you sit with me for a while? The healer left me a sleeping draught, but I am too dizzy to rest yet. Everything is swaying... are there really three of you?~
@5691 = ~No, there is only one of me.~
@5692 = ~Naturally! Which one do you like best?~
@5693 = ~I should really go and leave you to your rest.~
@5694 = ~I would not be so sure. Who knows, perhaps now my mind is clearly focused, and it's yours that is out of tune?~
@5695 = ~The one who just winked at me? No, wait, you didn't... did you?~
@5696 = ~Here, sit closer. Ah, now I see - there is one of you, after all. The one and only.~
@5697 = ~I suppose this is how an inebriated man feels. Not that I often overindulge, but... memories remain. In a way, it is pleasant: feels like I am ready to spill every secret at once.~
@5698 = ~Do you have secrets?~
@5699 = ~Well, what are you waiting for? Spill them, already!~
@5700 = ~Xan, I know your secrets: we are all doomed.~
@5701 = ~Everybody has them. Secrets, fears, dangerous mistakes... (sigh) What if we didn't, though? What if you and I were simply human? Neither elven nor divine, not involved with moonblades and Bhaal and Alaundo's prophecies?~
@5702 = ~But even then we would not be happy forever, you and me, would we? For I might follow Oghma, and you - Lathander, and those kindest and most benevolent of gods would cheerfully doom our souls to an eternal separation, or "blissful" oblivion, or rebirth. Funny, isn't it? Even going through the Blood War together would be better.~
@5703 = ~So what bothers you? The fact that I, a Bhaalspawn, won't have an afterlife?~
@5704 = ~Going through the Blood War together? That's quite a statement.~
@5705 = ~We could follow the same deity... although that wouldn't guarantee anything.~
@5706 = ~Anything would be better than what I have now.~
@5707 = ~Ever a romantic.~
@5708 = ~Is it so surprising that I have feelings for you and wish to remain with you? <CHARNAME>, you are many things, but you are far from blind.~
@5709 = ~You might have *some* sort of an afterlife in the abyssal realm, though I hardly know anything about it - I just expect the worst. I doubt Kelemvor or the Seldarine would take you in, anyhow.~
@5710 = ~(Xan closes his eyes for a moment, sweat visible on his brow.) Useless. I dream and dream... and in the end, you always die.~
@5711 = ~You are tired and in pain. Drink the potion, Xan. Go to sleep.~
@5712 = ~Then perhaps it is time to dream of something else?~
@5713 = ~Don't I know it. It is *my* lack of a proper afterlife, remember?~
@5714 = ~I wish I could share mine with you... but even if it were possible, I would say being trapped in the moonblade for centuries lost its appeal quite a while ago.~
@5715 = ~Would you give me the potion? I fear I will spill it in my current state.~
@5716 = ~Here. Sleep well.~
@5717 = ~Make an effort, Xan. Please.~
@5718 = ~(A smile appears on Xan's pale face.) You are the best of guardian angels, do you know that?~
@5719 = ~Very well... I shall just drink this at once, then.~
@5720 = ~The draught is working. I will probably be asleep within moments. And... <CHARNAME>?~
@5721 = ~Yes?~
@5722 = ~Sleep, Xan. You earned it.~
@5723 = ~Say "Thank you", or "I love you", and you're officially The Most Predictable Xan Ever.~
@5724 = ~I know.~
@5725 = ~Forgive me. I think you know what for... I...~
@5726 = ~(His eyes start closing.) No... I should say this, or... I never will.~
@5727 = ~I will bring you... only heartbreak and trouble. You know this; I know this. I don't think... I deserve your love, or ever will.~
@5728 = ~But I often dream of you by my side, dressed in naught but light... and then I know there will be light... we only have to wait for it. I wish it were... easier...~
@5729 = ~Should... enjoy every moment with you. Instead I complain and grumble and never just... trust the world to make it right. I will try harder, <CHARNAME>. I should...~
@5730 = ~Should've hidden you from Irenicus... should've never left your side... never will again. Till death... or eternal light...~
@5731 = ~(Sleep finally claims him, and his hand in yours goes limp. Yet his breathing is even and his face calm, and you can safely leave Xan for the night.)~
@5732 = ~I am afraid I will wake up and you will turn out to be a dream.~
@5733 = ~Me, a dream? Because I am alive after a rendezvous with Bodhi, you mean? Or is it the fact I exist at all?~
@5734 = ~That you are alive. You died in my head, you know. Dozens of times.~
@5735 = ~That you are real, and not a product of my imagination.~
@5736 = ~You are my dream made flesh. Won't you be unmade one day?~
@5737 = ~Both? It is too good to be true.~
@5738 = ~Oh, I die in my head every either hour. I try not to imagine your death too often, but... (sigh) Seems like our enemies would have a field day inside our own heads, doesn't it?~
@5739 = ~You must have some imagination, then. But wouldn't you come up with something more... lively? Less doomed? Brilliant and laughing, like yourself? I've always wondered...~
@5740 = ~(Xan takes you by both hands.) Too good for me, indeed.~
@5741 = ~I've heard of Netherese conjurers who created perfect simulacra, or magical clones, of themselves, to the last memory and voice inflection. With a tiny difference - the copy was of the opposite gender, so they could... love it. Play the perfect friend, lover, a surrogate father and child... to be close to someone as never before without risking their heart.~
@5742 = ~A doomed endeavor, naturally. For one, the simulacrum's time was finite. Imagine if you blinked and found out that you had only two or twenty years to live? Or that you weren't you at all, but a copy of yourself, suddenly male? Some say in their arrogance that ours is the superior gender, and I don't imagine they would take well to finding themselves in a female body.~
@5743 = ~And... well, the caster wanted to create a copy that would love him, but forgot that even a cloned mirror image would want to be loved and cared for unconditionally in return. And a rare Netherese summoner was so giving.~
@5744 = ~Why are you telling me this?~
@5745 = ~Didn't end well, then.~
@5746 = ~Are you comparing Netherese conjurers and their creations to you and me?~
@5747 = ~I will explain, melamin. Only the ending is left, now.~
@5748 = ~Some of these pairings lasted a while, surprisingly. I suppose it is hard not fall in love with oneself. But one day, one hour, one dreadful moment our original caster woke up and found out their partner was gone, disappeared into the ether. Dead, for the lack of better word. "It was all a dream."~
@5749 = ~I would be heartbroken if you disappeared.~
@5750 = ~It reminds me a bit of you and me, for some reason.~
@5751 = ~Yet it was real to them, wasn't it?~
@5752 = ~We are real, just like those couples were real. Yet when it is over, doesn't each day we leave in the past seem more and more like a dream?~
@5753 = ~<CHARNAME>, I understand your fear. Part of it is familiar to any: that our loved one will disappear from our lives.~
@5754 = ~And another part?~
@5755 = ~It is not fear, exactly. Just a feeling you exist in my imagination, and not in reality.~
@5756 = ~Ah, this fear. Yes, you could say we are quite close.~
@5757 = ~It must be very familiar to you.~
@5758 = ~Melamin, this fear *is* me. I'd wager it wears a moonblade and enjoys sighing on the windowsill, too.~
@5759 = ~Well, you may disagree here. But... truly, if someone loves and understands you, how can it not be a product of your imagination, at least in part?~
@5760 = ~Real people are messy, self-absorbed, and far from telepathic. Much of what you see in me is what you want to see, and some of what I think I know about you I do not know at all. Despite our bond, we cannot know each other's minds inside out.~
@5761 = ~So, yes. Some of me may be a product of your imagination. But here is the wonderful part: it will always remain with you. Even long after I am gone, there will be an inner me in your thoughts, a voice saying what I would have said, a vision smiling at you like I would have smiled. A dream - and yet real.~
@5762 = ~But you won't be with me.~
@5763 = ~A weak consolation when you are no longer there.~
@5764 = ~What of my initial fear, though? That you and me, here, now, are just a dream?~
@5765 = ~Some day, indeed, I won't be. But who knows, perhaps it will not be forever, and I shall see you on the other side?~
@5766 = ~I can only say one thing: if it is indeed a dream, we should enjoy it while it lasts. And if not - then happiness is ours. Don't you think?~
@5767 = ~For the moment.~
@5768 = ~Yep. Irenicus must be especially happy with my soul right now.~
@5769 = ~Let's enjoy it, then. Kiss me.~
@5770 = ~Ah, <CHARNAME>... so much can go wrong. So much has been lost. But...~
@5771 = ~(His lips touch your lips lightly.)~
@5772 = ~If this is a dream, please, please do not wake up.~
@5773 = ~Do you even love me anymore?~
@5774 = ~(Xan simply looks at you.)~
@5775 = ~Yes. And it makes it that much worse.~
@5776 = ~(Xan looks over his dusty robes in distaste and sighs. Then his gaze falls on you, and his expression softens.)~ [O#XAN000]
@5777 = ~<CHARNAME>, do you like surprises?~
@5778 = ~What? Nonononono. No. No!~
@5779 = ~Not nasty surprises, definitely.~
@5780 = ~I love them.~
@5781 = ~Depends on the surprise.~
@5782 = ~Oh, I do! Do you have one for me?~
@5783 = ~We are alike in this regard, it seems. Although you do like to surprise your enemies, I should say - and a well-aimed fireball is the least of those surprises.~
@5784 = ~Then, I hope, you will be delighted at the news. Better make your silent guesses now, for I am about to spill my secret in a moment.~
@5785 = ~This time it is a good one. At least, I hope so - and you do deserve a good solid surprise after everything we've been through in the graveyard.~
@5786 = ~I do, in fact. I would ask you to close your eyes, but we still have some way to go.~
@5787 = ~I found a bathhouse nearby, and given how our clothes and skin are full of sweat, grime and vampiric stench, I would say we dearly need to visit one. Besides, wouldn't you like to spend a relaxed evening in a whirling hot tub?~
@5788 = ~A bathhouse here? In the middle of nowhere?~
@5789 = ~Lead on, then.~
@5790 = ~Oh, Xan, not tonight. Let us just rest.~
@5791 = ~There is a large inn just a short walk from here. I've heard of it from Elhan's soldiers - indeed, they added quite a few locations to our modest map. It is funny how inns and taverns and small farms become islands of calm, when a war rages so close by, isn't it? But as long as innocents are safe...~
@5792 = ~So, what say you?~
@5793 = ~Now I am curious. All right, let's go.~
@5794 = ~A bath!~
@5795 = ~No, I would just like to rest.~
@5796 = ~Follow me, then. I'd carry you all the way, but if I try, I doubt we'd get there by the next morning. Although I seem to have a strength spell left...~
@5797 = ~Of course. You are probably exhausted.~
@5798 = ~As for me, I do not think I will rest at all. Perhaps I will read a little - or just look at you from time to time, stare into space and bask in quiet happiness.~
@5799 = ~And you know why? Because I am alive.~
@5800 = ~(The room you end up in is grand. There is a tub, already half-filled with hot water, a couch and a modest but practical selection of towels, soaps and oils.)~ [O#XAN000]
@5801 = ~(For a moment, the shining marble floor reminds you of polished stone slabs in Bodhi's lair, but the soothing sound of running water soon banishes the thought.)~
@5802 = ~(Xan disrobes next to you with a thoughtful look on his face.) You know, I never believed in sayings like "The winner takes all". But now I am starting to understand.~
@5803 = ~That we won?~
@5804 = ~That Bodhi will never take another bath?~
@5805 = ~Understand what? That we took all?~
@5806 = ~*That* she won't do, if I am any judge. You staked her quite well.~
@5807 = ~... You did stake her, didn't you? I'd hate to think she could interrupt us right now.~
@5808 = ~Well, you certainly looted the place most thoroughly, I must say.~
@5809 = ~We won. And we live - the most important victory of all. We exist - your naked shoulders, your hair, your feet on wet floor - you are here, alive, not a ghost or a memory.~
@5810 = ~(Your clothing falls to the floor as Xan takes you into his arms with care and slowly, gently lowers you into the blissfully warm water. Hot currents caress your body, small whirlpools form all over the tub, and the crypts you left behind seem like an old, faraway dream.)~
@5811 = ~(Xan settles next to you, nestling his head on a folded towel. His eyes are half-closed, but he does sneak a glance at your breasts now and then.)~
@5812 = ~I like it here.~
@5813 = ~What are you thinking of?~
@5814 = ~What are you thinking of? Don't tell me if it's about our doom.~
@5815 = ~Everything feels so good that I've almost forgotten I don't have a soul.~
@5816 = ~Me? You'll be surprised, but my thoughts are of you, yet again.~
@5817 = ~I am glad you look well. And feel well, it seems. I hope I'll be able to... keep you well, until your soul returns.~
@5818 = ~How?~
@5819 = ~Keep me well? What does it mean?~
@5820 = ~It means more hot baths and evenings of relaxation, I fully approve.~
@5821 = ~(Xan frowns briefly, then sighs, turning to you in the water.) You can still feel me through our bond, can you? Weaker, fainter, but our love is there.~
@5822 = ~I've been transferring my life force to you during our communion. As we shared thoughts, bodies, reverie... you became a little stronger.~
@5823 = ~And you never told me!~
@5824 = ~You probably saved my life.~
@5825 = ~Please, do not do this. I do not want you to.~
@5826 = ~Wasn't it dangerous?~
@5827 = ~I was sure I was going to die, melamin. What would it matter if I died feeling somewhat weaker?~
@5828 = ~We will face Irenicus within days, so I doubt I'll need to do it again. Your spirit... even as Irenicus holds most of it hostage, it has not waned yet. You still feel me... still reverie... still open your eyes in wonder. And I hope it will last. How can it not, with such mischief in your eyes?~
@5829 = ~(His hands travel down your arms, caressing your body. You never notice how a soaped loofah ends in his hands, but it does, and Xan starts massaging your knees and hips with it, his own face still deep in thought.)~
@5830 = ~Irenicus and Bodhi once were elves like you and me. She was beautiful, and probably kind at times; luxuriated in a bath, gazing at her lover through long eyelashes - not unlike you do now. Like me, Irenicus enjoyed wind in his hair, felt compassion, love... perhaps even wanted to help others?~
@5831 = ~What went wrong? Will we ever know?~
@5832 = ~Not if we live a thousand years, I hope.~
@5833 = ~I doubt Irenicus would want to tell.~
@5834 = ~No, and I do not want to.~
@5835 = ~Maybe? If Volo writes a book about them, for one.~
@5836 = ~Don't care? Please do that spot on my spine again... yes... yes, this is exactly the one.~
@5837 = ~Most likely, the rascal would rather lounge somewhere with his lute and a glass of crisp autumn wine. Make it a bottle.~
@5838 = ~(Xan raises an eyebrow.) The elders would be shocked that you would use the sacred elven bond for such things, you know. But I am happy to oblige.~
@5839 = ~(Xan finishes up his task with the loofah, paying particular attention to your more sensitive areas, and gives you a slight smile.)~
@5840 = ~In any case... we are here now, and Irenicus, thankfully, is not. Would you like a massage? Or would you prefer to lie here? With these currents, we'll never run out of hot water.~
@5841 = ~A massage sounds very nice. Oils?~
@5842 = ~Here is perfect.~
@5843 = ~Definitely. Just lie still. I will dry you in a moment.~
@5844 = ~(Xan deftly climbs out of the tub, and, dressed in barely more than a towel, scoops you up. A huge fluffy blanket wraps around you, and he dries your skin with relish.)~
@5845 = ~(A narrow couch stands close to the tub, and Xan lays you there on your belly, arms down at your sides. A faint scent of pine needles teases your nose as Xan unscrews a small bottle of oil.)~
@5846 = ~(His hands land on your back with a light touch at first, but with each smooth, gliding stroke the pressure increases, relaxing muscles you never suspected existed.)~
@5847 = ~Mmm. It feels good.~
@5848 = ~Yes... just like that.~
@5849 = ~Are you using magic?~
@5850 = ~(yawn) I am getting sleepy. Rest?~
@5851 = ~No magic this time. Just me.~
@5852 = ~Some would say "I am good", but I'll simply point out the obvious: look what I have to work with. My very own perfection.~
@5853 = ~(Xan leans in and kisses your neck before continuing the massage. His hands pay particular attention to the area around your shoulder blades, going lower and lower until each inch of your skin starts practically glowing with contentment.)~
@5854 = ~(Finally, he simply glides his hands up and down your back, thighs and hips, back and forth, back and forth, slowly and steadily... until your body sleepily whispers that it feels calm, still, blissful and completely relaxed.)~
@5855 = ~A'maelamin. Sometimes I wish we had a recording machine that would later repeat the wonderful sighs and sounds you made. Alas, it is not to be, but I quite enjoyed hearing them for the first time.~
@5856 = ~Thank you, Xan. It is good to be here with you.~
@5857 = ~Don't you want to hear them for the second time? Or maybe the third?~
@5858 = ~How about I massage your back? Or more than massage?~
@5859 = ~Why don't we get back into the water and I show you some of *my* skills?~
@5860 = ~Shall we rest now? It is going to be a long day tomorrow.~
@5861 = ~Well. We have the whole night, after all. Don't we?~
@5862 = ~And what a night it is going to be...~
@5863 = ~It is. Seldarine, it is amazing. Although with you, I'd be happy in the gutter.~
@5864 = ~To think that I could be in Arvandor now, locked in the afterlife, knowing nothing about your fate... No. Never. I wanted to die for you - and I would, but most of all I want to live. And to be with you.~
@5865 = ~And I'll make sure you keep that promise.~
@5866 = ~I like your priorities.~
@5867 = ~Xan, do you ever forget about death? Just for a moment?~
@5868 = ~Do you? Now that your spirit is gone?~
@5869 = ~But... yes. I do forget about death sometimes. Like now.~
@5870 = ~We'll get through this, <CHARNAME>. I know we will.~
@5871 = ~Of course, melamin. The bedroom, you'll find, is prepared and waiting just for you. Come.~
@5872 = ~We could do that role-playing thing we talked about in the graveyard...~
@5873 = ~So, the Underdark again.~ [O#XAN000]
@5874 = ~Yep.~
@5875 = ~You've got something to say about it?~
@5876 = ~And adventure! Wait, you don't like it?~
@5877 = ~Xan, don't start.~
@5878 = ~Wonderful. I wonder if my opinion even matters?~
@5879 = ~Oh, I wouldn't dream of doubting your decisions. After all, they've only led us to the Shadow Thieves, a coven of vampires, an asylum of mad mages and the city of drow. Minor matters, nothing to talk about.~
@5880 = ~Still. You are doomed, you know. Your soul is rather conspicuously missing. Don't you think you should do something about that instead?~
@5881 = ~You should've mentioned it BEFORE we went to Menzoberranzan, you know.~
@5882 = ~Too late. We're officially on this mission now. Can't go back.~
@5883 = ~I'm kind of comfortable this way, actually.~
@5884 = ~Given how many fell under your vicious onslaughts, I do not doubt it. Your taint must revel in it, now that your soul isn't here to keep it in check. All the more reason to confront Irenicus quickly.~
@5885 = ~(sigh) There wasn't time before Kimmuriel whisked us all underground. I couldn't warn you. And now I feel as it's all my fault. After all, who else in this Seldarine-forsaken company ever thinks rationally?~
@5886 = ~Xan, a lone voice of rationality. It has a certain ring to it.~
@5887 = ~Um, I do?~
@5888 = ~Well, Jaheira kind of does.~
@5889 = ~Xan, just say what you want to say.~
@5890 = ~I worry about you. You physical form is fine, but... you lack a SOUL. It's not a broken nail or a tooth or a missing finger. If this adventure lasts more than a few days, you're toast.~
@5891 = ~We shouldn't be here. I should have said something, done something. But... no matter. Our doom is here, and it's going to be quick and very painful, thanks to our drow friends.~
@5892 = ~And this time we're playing with legends. Jarlaxle, Kimmuriel Oblodra, Menzoberranzan - these are names that hold this world together. They always win, they do not die, and bad things happen to those who have the misfortune to join them.~
@5893 = ~You are in danger, <CHARNAME>. Watch your back.~
@5894 = ~What, because Jarlaxle's more famous than me? No way!~
@5895 = ~I will, Xan. Don't you worry.~
@5896 = ~I have you for that, remember?~
@5897 = ~(sigh) That's it. We're officially doomed.~
@5898 = ~<CHARNAME>, wait. We should rest first.~ [O#XAN000]
@5899 = ~Good idea.~
@5900 = ~I'm not that tired.~
@5901 = ~Again? Xan, seriously, you're about the sleepiest elf I've ever met.~
@5902 = ~Thank you. I believe the tavern's just this way.~
@5903 = ~I am, but it's not about fatigue. This is about our lives.~
@5904 = ~We are in the Underdark. Each opportunity to refresh our spells should be grabbed with both hands. Or claws, tentacles and other appendages.~
@5905 = ~Besides, I have a very shrewd suspicion that our quest fast approaches its pinnacle.~
@5906 = ~How so?~
@5907 = ~You may be right.~
@5908 = ~We deceived the Matron Mother, thanks to Kimmuriel. Now she will become an enemy. Add the fact that the rival house is about to attack and the last wardstone will soon fall into our grasp, and you will begin to see the whole picture.~
@5909 = ~When this happens, the tavern will likely be closed to us: rest will not be an option. We must be ready.~
@5910 = ~We can go to the lust chambers.~
@5911 = ~I am always ready.~
@5912 = ~Good thinking.~
@5913 = ~I don't care. Rested or not, I will fight my way through.~
@5914 = ~(groan) <CHARNAME>, really? And be slaughtered in our sleep?~
@5915 = ~Even Saemon Havarian would say it is a mistake, you know. Though I suppose you always do what you want, and pity your enemies.~
@5916 = ~We're still doomed, you know. Rest or no, some evil beholder or possibly an Elder Orb is watching, and they won't be content until our cold dead bodies are thrown into the Clawrift.~
@5917 = ~Still, I'd rather go to my death well-rested. Shall we?~
@5918 = ~The sky! And our drow things are dissolving into dust. Again. ~ [O#XAN000]
@5919 = ~Such is life.~
@5920 = ~Xan wouldn't be Xan if he didn't complain.~
@5921 = ~Who cares about these drow rags? We've got treasure!~
@5922 = ~Oh, <CHARNAME>, <CHARNAME>... Good to see some things in this world do not change.~
@5923 = ~I shouldn't complain: we're alive. And yet... I don't know. Something's missing. A grand goodbye?~
@5924 = ~I liked the way it ended.~
@5925 = ~I've got my fond farewell. I think Kimmuriel took a liking to me.~
@5926 = ~Jarlaxle said goodbye, and Kimmuriel. Artemis didn't, but he's kind of grouchy anyway.~
@5927 = ~True. I missed the fanfare. And cake.~
@5928 = ~I suppose. I half-expected that Jarlaxle would have another task for us, and we'd be dragged into another adventure. Still, one can't have everything.~
@5929 = ~You don't say? Interesting. But I wouldn't be surprised: you are astute, charming and beautiful. (sigh) And a Child of Bhaal besides.~
@5930 = ~True, but between aiding a lone Child of Bhaal against a treacherous drow captain and saying an eloquent goodbye, I'll choose the former any time.~
@5931 = ~You know what they say: the cake is a lie.~
@5932 = ~I think it was wise of you to help Kimmuriel in the long run. Should we need aid, I suppose Bregan D'aerthe will come handy.~
@5933 = ~Though I dearly hope we'll never need aid *that* badly. Elhan's people will help us, and there is your own might to consider. Speaking of which, how are you?~
@5934 = ~Exhausted. We should find a place to rest.~
@5935 = ~In a hurry. We've got lots of gems to sell!~
@5936 = ~Well enough. A bit hungry, though.~
@5937 = ~I'm fine. How are you?~
@5938 = ~Ribald will be happy to accommodate us, I suppose. Although you might want to save a star sapphire or two for later. I'm told they make great pommel gems.~
@5939 = ~Bruised and battered, but I'll live. Hungry, too, for some reason. Usually the sense of doom blocks my appetite.~
@5940 = ~We need a good meal. And this time, you're not doing the cooking. The Brynnlaw Chicken Disaster is still vivid in my memory.~
@5941 = ~That drunk sailor blew the oven up! I wasn't even near it!~
@5942 = ~Pfft. Look at you, Mister-Boil-The-Cabbage-Straight-To-Hell!~
@5943 = ~And a *private* room with a soft bed. And absolutely no one else in the vicinity.~
@5944 = ~Xan? I'm glad we're still talking as friends. After all this.~
@5945 = ~Deal. But you're buying.~
@5946 = ~Right. And various chicken bits ended up sticking out of his ears, mouths and pants all on their own, I believe.~
@5947 = ~I am quite sure I have no idea whatsoever what you're talking about.~
@5948 = ~Absolutely. Shall we start our search now?~
@5949 = ~I... I am sorry, <CHARNAME>, but I am not ready to speak to you of this yet. Not in earnest. I am a fool, I know, but... let's get your soul back first. Please.~
@5950 = ~Somehow I expected this. Very well.~
@5951 = ~And... <CHARNAME>? It will be my pleasure.~
@5952 = ~Let us go. A new day awaits us.~
@5953 = ~Another journey to Spellhold. Wonderful. Just perfect. Or have I said all this before?~ [O#XAN000]
@5954 = ~No, but by all means, go on.~
@5955 = ~Imagine: all those lockers and chests, filled anew with incredible treasure!~
@5956 = ~A chance to retrieve my soul without engaging Irenicus? Yes, please!~
@5957 = ~(sigh) Xan, just say that we're all doomed and shut up.~
@5958 = ~(sigh) What is the point? It's hopeless. Resistance is futile.~
@5959 = ~(groan) And brand new Cowled Wizards, hungry for blood. Speaking of which, were it their mantles I just saw?~
@5960 = ~Tell me true: do you really believe that your soul will return? Just like that? Another mage snaps his fingers, and hundreds of miles away, Irenicus will fall unconscious?~
@5961 = ~Probably not. But a chance is better than nothing.~
@5962 = ~I can see it happening, yes.~
@5963 = ~Xan, look at me and ask yourself: have I ever said 'no' to a new adventure?~
@5964 = ~(sigh) Hopeless.~
@5965 = ~In any case, I am coming with you, if you let me. You'll need some bodies to throw themselves at your new and improved enemies, I believe.~
@5966 = ~And something tells me there won't be many volunteers.~
@5967 = ~I thought I knew all kinds of insanity known to men. Obviously I was mistaken.~ [O#XAN000]
@5968 = ~Are you speaking of Dora?~
@5969 = ~Dora didn't seem insane to me.~
@5970 = ~What are you talking about?~
@5971 = ~Who else? The image is still vivid in my memory, wild eyes and all.~
@5972 = ~No? Then again, you two are birds of a feather.~
@5973 = ~Roslin's former apprentice, Dora, of course.~
@5974 = ~The girl lost her soul. And instead of trying to survive, keeping her head low and waiting for her mentor to aid her, she decided to reshape the world according to her newly found insanity!~
@5975 = ~Truly, Brynnlaw is doomed. A band of vigilantes running about, killing all criminals and enforcing law as they understand it? This town will be in ruins by the end of the year.~
@5976 = ~I don't agree with everything they do. But pirates *are* common in Brynnlaw.~
@5977 = ~Someone has to keep order. Brynnlaw had no militia.~
@5978 = ~I agree, their methods are too cruel. Perhaps once Dora returns her soul, it will change.~
@5979 = ~Dora told us that nobody came to help her! Of course she wanted to do something!~
@5980 = ~Should I even care? I just want my soul back.~
@5981 = ~Too true. Still, I'd rather Dora's actions were less... radical.~
@5982 = ~No, and I wonder why that is. Perhaps Cowled Wizards are supposed to keep order? No wonder Dora said they supported her. Wouldn't want to dirt their own hands, I suppose.~
@5983 = ~I hope so. Much as I dislike rowdy singing in the night, the singers do not deserve to be beheaded.~
@5984 = ~Like a miniature revolution? Oh, yes, very sensible indeed.~
@5985 = ~I care. Very few people were robbed of their souls and survived, you know.~
@5986 = ~Dora lost her soul earlier than you. Perhaps your reactions will not be dissimilar to hers. (cough) Do tell me if you suddenly wake up and decide to change the world, will you?~
@5987 = ~Before or after the fact?~
@5988 = ~I am the new Dark Ruler of the world! World, beware!~
@5989 = ~But I'm going to change the world anyway! Remember Alaundo's prophecies?~
@5990 = ~All right.~
@5991 = ~We'll see.~
@5992 = ~Hmm. Will you help?~
@5993 = ~(sigh) And, as ever, we are doomed.~
@5994 = ~Seldarine. The very halls where you and Imoen lost your souls...~ [O#XAN000]
@5995 = ~<CHARNAME>... I swear, when I see Irenicus, I'm going to Abi-Dalzim him straight to oblivion, even if it dooms me. This atrocity must be reversed.~
@5996 = ~Thank you, Xan. I am touched.~
@5997 = ~I fully agree.~
@5998 = ~Just prepare dispelling spells. Our blades will do the rest.~
@5999 = ~We'll Abi-Dalzim him together. He'll wilt like a tender flower. A very DEAD flower.~
@6000 = ~Just don't get yourself killed. Who would tell me I'm doomed?~
@6001 = ~You're one of a kind, <CHARNAME>. Until you recover your soul, I will be at your side for as long as you need me.~
@6002 = ~(sigh) Unless Irenicus casts Time Stop first.~
@6003 = ~You'll find someone, I am sure. Just don't tell them they are doomed with you.~
@6004 = ~There'll probably never be another time to tell you... I was really worried on that night. We were locked in a small cell, nobody knew what Irenicus was doing to you, and then Bodhi brought us to the labyrinth, where you nearly fainted, and then turned...~
@6005 = ~Into the Slayer. But you remained by my side.~
@6006 = ~Into the Slayer. And you abandoned me.~
@6007 = ~I know you care, Xan. I'll be fine. Everything will be all right.~
@6008 = ~I'd rather not relive those hours.~
@6009 = ~That's what friends do.~
@6010 = ~Always.~
@6011 = ~You need someone who'll love you better than I, you know this. Perhaps one day you'll agree with this truth.~
@6012 = ~(sigh) If only...~
@6013 = ~We won't talk about this, then.~
@6014 = ~Just know I am ready, come what may. Good or evil, life or death. Who knows: perhaps you'll live a simple life, become a paragon and a force of balance and good... or sit on the Throne of Murder.~
@6015 = ~But I can live with that. Come. Let's finish this adventure and go home. Irenicus won't wait forever.~
