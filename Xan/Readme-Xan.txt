1. Introduction
----------------

Xan NPC MOD for Baldur's Gate II (Xan for short) is an add-on for the game
Baldur's Gate II, with or without the Throne of Bhaal expansion pack.
Throne of Bhaal content is present.

Xan, a non-player character from the first game in Baldur's Gate series, is a
depressed elven mage - enchanter. Notable quotes: "We're all doomed."
"Life is so hollow." "It is hardly worth the effort of trying."
"What is the point?" "Our quest is vain." "Onward, to futility!"

----------------

During the installation you may change Xan's class to Fighter/Mage, Mage, Wild
Mage(ToB only) or Sorcerer. To decline, choose "N"("No"). To return to Enchanter,

As well, you will have an option to install BG1-style flaming sword animations
for Xan's moonblade, courtesy of Erephine, the author of One Pixel Productions.


Mac OS X:

-----------------------
3. General Information
-----------------------


a. Overview
------------

Xan can be found in the Government District of Athkatla, near the main entrance.
You do not need to start a new game to get him into your party.

In ToB, Xan can also be summoned from the Pocket Plane Fate Spirit.

Xan has an extensive friendship path with the PC, a minimum of three banters with
every Bioware NPC, a vast amount of interjections, character reactions and other
scenery dialogue. 

Xan also has two romance paths for a female elven PC: for more information, see
"Romances" below.

All three paths are dialogue-heavy, including sequential dialogues, dialogues
reactive to the events of the game, and player-initiated dialogues.

A short "future romance" path is available to female protagonists of every race
in the Throne of Bhaal expansion pack.

Xan also has three character-related encounters and four character-related
quests, not counting the encounter with Bodhi in Chapter 6 for the bonded path.
For more information, see "Quests and Encounters" below.

When Xan's experience hits 1500000XP, his moonblade can be upgraded. Talk to him.
For the Fighter-Mage class, it receives the following additional abilities:

Vocalize
+4 enchantment
+1 extra attack

For the Enchanter, Mage, Sorcerer and Wild Mage classes, the blade receives
the following additional abilities:

Vocalize
+4 enchantment
Invisibility as per the Staff of the Magi

TIP: Get your PC drunk at some point in SoA. You will not regret it.

If you experience any problems with Xan's select/confirm sounds, select him
in the game and press K key. This should fix the problem.


b. Player-Initiated Dialogues
------------------------------

At any moment of the game you will be able to click on Xan and get a player-
initiated menu. Note these two options, available for every path:

"May I ask you a question?" You may find some interesting information here. 
Some answers are based on game events, your reputation and the path you have
chosen, others are the same for every path.

"May I talk to you?" You can manage your relationship, turn flirts on and off,
try to change the path you have taken, or talk. Some dialogues are available
right away, others are added in the course of the game.

In ToB player-initiated dialogues are available through the option "Let us talk".


c. Romances
------------

If your PC is an elven female and your game is in Chapter 2 or 3, you may start
a romance with Xan. To do so, simply choose the FIRST OPTION a menu you will get
upon meeting him.

If you played and enjoyed Xan Romance by the same author, included into
the BG1 NPC Project, you may continue it, choosing the SECOND OPTION in a menu
you will get upon meeting Xan. This path is called the bonded path, since PC and
Xan have formed an elven bond in BG1. Again, elven female PC, Chapter 2 or 3.

The BG1 NPC Project is available at http://gibberlings3.net/bg1npc

Note that these two are different relationships, and as such, they have
different dialogues and outcomes. As ever, be prepared for nasty surprises.

TIP: If you wish to enjoy the first romance path fully, DO NOT RUSH TO CHAPTER 4.

Both relationships include Xan-initiated and PC-initiated flirts, different
for each relationship. After certain events, flirts are disabled.

TIP: Check your "May I talk to you?" option from time to time - there will be new
talks, even in impossible circumstances.

Romances are continued in ToB... in a way. If you have chosen the tragic
ending for the bonded path, taking Valygar with you into ToB is recommended.


SPOILER SECTION
---------------

It is well-known to Xan players that in the non-bonded path, Xan and his
CHARNAME go through a rough period after Spellhold, yet are reunited in ToB. 

But the bonded path ended at Bodhi's graveyard: Xan died every time and
his CHARNAME was left alone. It is time to change that, and give Xan
and his heroine a happy ending.

From version 10 onwards, there is an option to save Xan in the bonded path. 

Explore new player-initiated options in "May I talk to you?" menu to learn more.
There is also Xan-initiated dialogue at the beginning of Chapter 6.

There is new dialogue for the subsequent events and a romance track for the
ToB portion, plus a new flirt pack, player-initiated dialogues and
two new epilogues. Try resting outdoors at night in ToB - you won't regret it.

There are ten Xan-initiated lovetalks in the bonded path for ToB. 
The last one starts with these words: "Well. I wanted to talk to you,
but it seems I've run out of things to say. Does this even happen anymore?"

There are two additional dialogues at rest in SoA: late in romance outdoors
in Athkatla, if Xan is wounded(it is available in the non-bonded path, as well),
and after Bodhi's death, not in a dungeon, and not in Chapter 7.

There are six additional dialogues at rest in ToB: after meeting Gorion's Wraith,
killing Yaga-Shura, defeating Sendai or Abazigail(these three are available in
the non-bonded path, as well), one in a tavern(Saradush or Amkethran), and 
two happen at rest outdoors at night, one - anywhere but in Saradush,
another - in Chapter 9, and not outside the Watcher's Keep.

You will be able to summon a "bonded" Xan even if you start a fresh ToB game.


d. Quests and Encounters
-------------------------

There are three minor encounters and four full quests in the mod. The first
encounter involves one of Trademeet's merchants. The second one takes part
in the lust chambers of a certain city, and is romance-related. The third
one happens in Amkethran if you are on the bonded path, or after you ask Xan
about the letter he received.

There is also an encounter with Bodhi for the bonded path in chapter 6, in
Athkatla's Graveyard District. There are two outcomes to that encounter -
- see "Romances"(spoiler section) to learn more.

The first SoA quest starts in the Temple District, the second SoA quest
starts in the slums, the third SoA quest starts in Chapter 6,
at the Underdark Exit, and the ToB quest takes place in Amkethran.


Walkthrough:


SPOILERS START HERE


Encounters: 

1) The first encounter is with the merchant who sells the Robe of Good Archmagi
and the Robe of Neutral Archmagi in Trademeet. For five thousand gold, he will
return Xan's Robe of Neutral Archmagi, but only if Xan is in party, in the area,
and able to talk.

2) The Lust chambers(the inn of Ust Natha, second floor): a drow female, Hunrae,
stands in the middle of the entrance hall. She will dismiss the party, if Xan
is not present, otherwise she will demand his services. PC may choose to stand
aside, or to get involved in the conflict. If the player chooses to 
participate in Ricar's quest in Chapter 6, they will meet Hunrae again.
The encounter is only available if one of the romance paths has been chosen.

3) If you are talked to Xan about a letter from Evereska in ToB via his
player-initiated menu, or if you are on the bonded path, you will see Ricar
again in Chapter 9 - he finds the player in Amkethran. After a conversation
he gives you a magical cloak and leaves.


Quests:

1) This quest is available upon entering the Temple District in Athkatla.
An elven girl approaches Xan and asks him to find her father. The clues
indicate he might be in the Temple of Talos, and he is indeed there. However,
Rotan, the girl's father, is mad. Weathermistress Ada agrees to return his 
sanity, but only if PC retrieves the Talos' ring to the temple. The thieves
are rumored to meet in the Copper Coronet.

PC has two opportunities: to bribe the thieves, or to kill them all. In both
cases it is revealed that the ring is with their other member, Selia, in the
temple of Lathander. If Xan is in the party, he makes Selia return the ring,
otherwise, PC has to pay a thousand gold(Selia teleports away, if attacked).

Weathermistress Ada rewards the party, and Rotan is reunited with his daughter.

2) This quest is available upon entering the slums with Xan in the party. A
rogue stands near the Copper Coronet. When talked to, he implores Xan to flee
the city, because something "terrible and wondrous" will happen soon. After
this meeting, he will wait in the Government District, near the main entrance,
at night.

If PC meets him with Xan in party, the rogue will arrange a meeting with his
superiors, who are revealed to belong to Eldreth Veluuthra, an organization
determined to wipe all humans from the face of Faerun. They ask for assistance
in poisoning the temples and the government of the city.

There are two choices. Should PC interfere in the discussion, the encounter
eventually leads to violence. Should PC remain silent, or refuse to get 
involved, the group departs, and the quest is over - unless PC tells
Inspector Brega of this, in which case the party is ambushed by this group
after their next rest outdoors.

After the group is dead, the party can address Chief Inspector Brega, and he
will reward the party with one thousand gold pieces.

3) This quest is available upon exiting the Underdark in chapter 6, if Xan is
in party. After the talk with Elhan, a mage, Ricar, teleports next to Elhan.
The player can choose to agree right away, or to refuse, in which case it is
possible to approach Ricar later.

Ricar and the party journey to Irenicus' Dungeon. When they finally exit,
they have to battle an Adamantite golem, and then head to Elhan. They are 
given a task to find the drow group. Hunrae, the group's leader,
can be found in the North Forest, the upper left corner of the map. 

The player can either believe Hunrae and let her go, or to attack her. In both
cases, the player should report to Ricar and Elhan for the quest's conclusion.

If Hunrae was killed, a drow mage will confront the party in Athkatla.

4) This quest is available in ToB, in Chapter 9, in Amkethran. Siene, an elven
girl, will approach the party, if Xan is in party, and ask them for help. The
party can agree immediately or choose to delay the encounter, and approach her
afterwards. 

Upon meeting the slavers, the party can choose to either let the
slavers pass(in which case all three elven girls remain enslaved), attack
the slavers(in which case all three elven girls are killed immediately), or
try and free the girls. PC can propose themselves as a hostage, or ask Xan to
do it. Another solution would be bribing their mercenaries.

Should Xan propose himself as a hostage, a mercenary will approach the party
within a few minutes. PC may choose to pay the ransom, bribe the mercenary, or
threaten him(INT>14 or WIS>14 or CHA>14), in which case Xan appears in a hut
that the party passes on the way to the upper Amkethran. Otherwise Xan will
approach the party in Amkethran a day later.

One more day later, Xan will initiate conversation. Should the player desire to,
they can confront the slavers in Amkethran(the bottom left corner of the map)
again and finally put an end to their existence.
